    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was turning dusk
      in the office, though it was scarcely three o&rsquo;clock and outside the
      sun was still shining, beyond the busy streets. The two men sitting on
      opposite sides of the small room bent closer to their desks. The younger
      glanced up and got up to turn on the electric light. The little scowl that
      had begun to form itself on the face of the older man changed to a look of
      relief. His pen moved faster over the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older man was Simeon Tetlow, President of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo;
      Railroad. It might almost be said that he <i>was</i> the road. Its minute
      ramifications and its great divisions were hardly more than the nerves and
      arteries that threaded Simeon Tetlow&rsquo;s thin frame. And the orders
      that went out from the tiny office, high up in the big block, were the
      play of his flitting finger-tips upon the keyboard of the whole clanking
      system. The tiny, shriveled figure gave no hint of the power that ticked
      carloads of live stock and human beings to their destination and laid its
      hand upon roads half dead, or dying, or alive and kicking, sweeping them
      gently into the system, with hardly a gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon Tetlow was an iron man, wiry and keen&mdash;an intellect without
      heart or soul or conscience, his co-workers would have told you. Each new
      road absorbed, each influx of power, seemed only to tighten a spring
      somewhere inside that shot the bolt. He conld work day and night without
      tiring; and that was the reason, in part, why at forty-two he was
      president of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; road; and the reason why at
      forty-two his hand, when it reached out for its abstemious glass of water,
      trembled so that it was quickly withdrawn. No one knew the man. No one
      guessed the nervous horror that often racked the small frame driven
      relentlessly by its big brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out for a slip of paper that lay at hand and ran his eye over
      it, jotting down a few figures. Then he pushed it to one side and went on
      writing. The younger man came across the office and laid another slip of
      paper on the desk. He took the one that had been pushed aside, made a
      memorandum on it, and filed it in a pigeon-hole at the right. He was a
      short, young man, with broad shoulders and a round face. The face as it
      bent above the slip of paper had a dull look. There was a kind of patience
      in it not usual in so young a man, and when he turned his eyes to his
      employer they glowed with a clear light, as if something were shining
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, John?&rdquo; The man reached out a nervous, groping
      hand. His gaze had not left the page before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one next, sir.&rdquo; The young man touched the outstretched
      hand with the slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; It was almost testy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other returned to his desk and the scratching pens raced with the
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A call-boy entered with a handful of letters. The young man took them and
      ran them through his fingers. He arranged them in piles, reserving a part
      for himself. These he read, making notes and filing them rapidly. One
      letter, the one at the bottom of the pack, was not addressed to the great
      corporation, but&mdash;in a fine, small hand&mdash;to &ldquo;John Bennett.&rdquo;
      He read this one last, looking thoughtfully at the lines and folding it
      with slow fingers. The patient look was still in his face, but the light
      of the eyes was gone. It seemed to have sunk back, leaving the flesh dull
      and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His employer glanced up suddenly. His quick eye sought the electric bulb,
      with a flash of impatience, and returned to its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man rose and turned on more lights. He moved about the room,
      putting things away for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon Tetlow finished his letters and pushed them from him. The young man
      came across and began to gather them up. His dull face came in range of
      his employer&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give those I &rsquo;ve marked to Hanscom. Have the rest ready in
      the morning. I shall dictate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The young man finished gathering them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man glanced again, half-impatiently, at the heavy face. The room
      seemed suddenly gloomy, in spite of the red-hot wires looping the light
      about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man brought a hat and coat and laid them beside his employer.
      &ldquo;May I speak to you a minute, sir?&rdquo; he asked as he put them
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other glanced again, sharply, at his face. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo; His
      hand was reaching for the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to hand in my resignation, sir.&rdquo; The young man
      said it slowly, as if repeating something he had learned by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand on the hat drew back. &ldquo;What &rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He
      laughed curtly and shot a look of suspicion at the impassive face. &ldquo;More
      money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The face flushed. &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; He hesitated a little. &ldquo;My
      mother is sick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s face cleared. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      need to resign for <i>that</i>.&rdquo; He did not ask what was the matter
      with the mother. He had not known that John had a mother. She seemed to be
      springing into existence very inconveniently. &ldquo;Get a nurse,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has had a nurse. But she needs me, I think.&rdquo; He did not
      offer more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older man shrugged his shoulders a little&mdash;a quick shrug. He
      pushed forward a chair with his foot. &ldquo;Sit down. Your father dead?&rdquo;
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. But&mdash;father is&mdash;father.&rdquo; He said it with a
      little smile. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s never had anybody but me,&rdquo; he went
      on quickly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been sick ever since I was a little thing,
      and I&rsquo;ve taken care of her. It frets her to have a woman around. She
      does n&rsquo;t wash the dishes clean, and her cooking is n&rsquo;t really
      very good.&rdquo; He was smiling a little as he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shot a quick look at him. &ldquo;You &rsquo;re going home to wash
      dishes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m.&rdquo; The fingers played a little tune on the desk. &ldquo;I
      &rsquo;ll raise you twenty-five a month. Get a better nurse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy shook his head. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m afraid it would n&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
      He was hesitating. &ldquo;I think she misses me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! Very likely!&rdquo; The man glanced at him over quick
      spectacles. &ldquo;What &rsquo;s the matter with her? Sit down.&rdquo; He
      touched the chair again with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man sat down. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what it is. She cannot
      walk&mdash;cannot stand&mdash;a good deal of the time&mdash;and sometimes
      she suffers. But it is a kind of nervousness that is hardest to bear. She
      cannot lie quiet. Something seems to drive her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded. His fingers opened and closed. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; he
      said brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;s all&mdash;except that it quiets her to have me
      around. I can get work in Bridgewater and do the housework nights and
      mornings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was scowling at him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s what I &rsquo;ve always done, till I came here,&rdquo;
      he said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washed dishes and cooked and made beds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no work for a <i>man</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; The dull face smiled a little. &ldquo;The boys
      always called me &rsquo;Sissie Johnny.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! I &rsquo;m glad they did!... &rsquo;Sissie Johnny&rsquo;!&rdquo;
      He smiled grimly and took a card from the desk before him, holding it a
      minute in his fingers, snapping it back and forth. &ldquo;Has she ever
      seen a specialist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head. &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; The man wrote a few
      words on the card and blotted it quickly. &ldquo;Take her to see Dr.
      Blake. He is the best nerve specialist in five hundred miles. If she is n&rsquo;t
      well enough to go to him, have him come to her. I &rsquo;ll pay the bill.&rdquo;
      He thrust himself into his hat and coat and got himself out of the room,
      shrugging nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood with the card in his hand, looking at it, a little
      smile on his lips. Then he went about, turning out all the bulbs but one
      and putting away papers and arranging the room for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small, rough room&mdash;hardly more than a corner cut off from
      the top floor by board partitions. The rest of the floor, outside, was
      used only for storage. Simeon Tetlow had achieved here what he wanted&mdash;complete
      solitude. There was, on the first floor, a magnificent apartment with
      lordly mahogany chairs, a baize-covered table and oil paintings, where
      twice a year he met his directors; and on the floor above it was a
      spacious room bearing on its panel the bronze token, &ldquo;President&rsquo;s
      Office.&rdquo; It was occupied at present by three young lady typewriters
      who clacked their machines and arranged their hair and adjusted the shades
      on the plate-glass windows to suit their convenience, while in the little
      room at the top of the building the president of the corporation hunched
      himself over a four-dollar desk and scowled at the dim light that came
      through the half-sized windows. For three days after it was finished,
      Simeon Tetlow occupied the spacious room below designed for the president
      of the corporation. Then he gathered together his few belongings and fled
      to the top. His gigantic brain could only work when free from distraction.
      The mere sense that some one might rap, even on the outer door of the
      stately office, paralyzed him, and his nervous frame, once set a-jangle,
      trembled, and palpitated for hours. The mere forbidding of intrusion was
      not sufficient. Some well-meaning idiot, laden with news of importance,
      would break over the command, and hours of careful thought would be
      whirled aloft in the smoke of Simeon&rsquo;s wrath. He fled to the loft,
      dropping, as it were, a trapdoor behind him. No one was to follow&mdash;unless
      summoned. No literary man was ever more jealous of solitude. But no mere
      literary man could think a railroad into existence or quench a wheat crop
      with a nod. If Simeon Tetlow&rsquo;s body had matched his brain, there
      would have been no limit to his power. As it was, he remained a mighty
      general without an army, a head without hands and feet. The details of
      life frustrated him at every point. He could meet his directors, serene in
      the knowledge that the road was prospering beyond all bounds. He could
      carry to them the facts and figures and proofs of prosperity&mdash;in his
      head. But the papers that recorded these facts, the proofs in black and
      white, were never forthcoming at the right moment. They took to themselves
      wings&mdash;of paper; they flitted and skulked and hid; they lay on the
      top of the pile before him and grinned at him, their very faces changed to
      a diabolic scorn that he should not know them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the Simeon Tetlow of three years ago. Then there entered, one
      morning, in response to his summons for a call-boy, a short, square youth
      with a dull face. Simeon did not note him as he came in. He forgot that he
      had called for a boy. His mind was busy with projects of import. When it
      came back, with a start, he recognized that some one had been with him,
      for ten minutes or more, who had not worried and irritated him by merely
      being alive. He shot a keen glance at the dull face. The light of the eyes
      was turned to him, waiting to serve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Simeon summoned the boy again and again, on one pretext or
      another. He made excuses to see him. He advanced him from post to post.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, about a year ago, he nodded at a desk that had been installed,
      overnight, across the room: &ldquo;You are to work there and your pay will
      be raised a hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy took possession of the desk with as little stir as if he had
      received some casual order. He did not ask what his work was to be, and
      Simeon Tetlow did not tell him. The big brain had found hands and feet&mdash;almost,
      it might seem, lungs and a few other useful, vital organs&mdash;and it
      used them, as it had used the nervous, shaking body before&mdash;relentlessly.
      For the first time in his life Simeon found his papers ready to his hand.
      He attended his first directors&rsquo; meeting, sitting at the head of the
      green baize table, like a man in a dream. The right paper slipped to his
      finger-tips and lingered there; the figures formed themselves in seemly
      ranks and marched up and down the green baize parade in orderly file. The
      effect upon the directors was, at first, a little startling. They had
      become wonted to Simeon hurried, gasping, and impatient&mdash;and to
      dividends. They were almost afraid of these cold facts and figures. They
      looked at them cautiously, through gold-rimmed glasses, received their
      dividends&mdash;and took heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day some new comfort found its way to Simeon&rsquo;s desk. The
      morning that the box of elastic bands appeared there was a holocaust of
      joy among the papers. He used nearly the whole box the first day. He had
      never owned an elastic band before. He was president of the great
      corporation, but it had not occurred to him that he had a right to elastic
      bands. He slid them up and down his nervous fingers in sheer energy of
      delight. But he did not mention them to John, nor John to him. It was John
      who provided the new letter-file that cut the work in half, and had the
      grimy windows washed till they shone like plate, and arranged the desk
      &rsquo;phone so that Simeon could dictate to the stenographer three floors
      below, without knowing, or caring, who sat at the other end taking his
      crisp words with harried, compliant fingers. Hitherto, dictating had
      burdened Simeon&rsquo;s life. He had written dozens of letters himself
      rather than endure the presence of a stenographer for even half an hour;
      and the sound of a girl clacking drove him wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters that were not dictated into the telephone were written in John&rsquo;s
      round, conscientious-looking hand. If there were anything that one human
      being could do for another that was not done in the office, Simeon did not
      know what it was&mdash;nor did John. A clothes-brush that brushed them
      twice a day hung by Simeon&rsquo;s hat and coat; and if Simeon&rsquo;s
      neckties were still shabby and his collars a little frayed, it was because
      John had not yet discovered the remedy. Some days a luncheon appeared on
      Simeon&rsquo;s desk, and some days he went out to luncheon; and he could
      not have told which, except that it was always the thing that he would
      have done had he devoted hours of thought to it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not give thanks to John, and John did not expect them. The lamps in
      his eyes had not been lighted for that&mdash;nor for money....
    </p>
    <p>
      He went about the room now in his slow, considerate way, attending to each
      detail of locking up, as carefully as if he were not to be first on the
      ground in the morning.... He would return to start the day. Later&mdash;perhaps
      at noon&mdash;he would slip away. That would make least trouble.... To
      come in the morning and find him gone!&mdash;John felt, through all his
      short, square figure, the shock to the nervous, quivering one. He did not
      need to reason it out. He did not even know that he thought it. It was an
      instinct&mdash;born the first day he came into Simeon Tetlow&rsquo;s
      office and saw the thin figure seated before its chaotic desk wrestling
      its way through mighty things.... He had thought of his mother as he stood
      there waiting for orders. She had fairly driven him away. &ldquo;Go and be
      a <i>man!</i>&rdquo; she had said; &ldquo;I shall ruin you.&rdquo; And she
      had smiled at him courageously.... And he had come away, and had taken the
      first thing at hand&mdash;a call-boy, kicking his heels against a bench
      with a dozen others. And this was his employer.... So he had stood waiting
      when Simeon Tetlow had looked up and seen the lamps aglow.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was three years ago. And tonight Simeon, plodding home through the
      foggy gloom, was swearing a little under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s the weak spot in the boy,&rdquo; he said testily;
      &ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s soft at the core.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He inserted his latchkey, grumbling still. &ldquo;Wash dishes&mdash;will
      he? Damn him!&mdash;Umph!&mdash;Damn him!&rdquo; And yet it was as if he
      had said: &ldquo;Bless him!&rdquo; The great door swung noiselessly open,
      and he went in.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he woman was
      looking into the dusk. Her hair, short like a boy&rsquo;s, curled a little
      about the ears. She pushed it back as she looked, her eyes deepening and
      widening. It was a gentle face, with a sharp line between the eyes, that
      broke its quiet. She sank back with a little sigh. Foolish to look.... He
      could not come. She must think of something.... The twilights were long
      and heavy.... What was it he had written?... Hollyhocks? yes; that was it!&mdash;in
      the garden. He had said she should have them&mdash;next summer. She leaned
      back with closed eyes and folded hands, watching them&mdash;pink and rose
      and crimson, white with flushing red, standing stiff and straight against
      the wall. They were so cool and sturdy, and they brought the sunshine....
      The dark floated wide and lost itself in a sky of light. The smile crept
      back to her lips. She stirred a little. The door opened and closed.... His
      hands scarcely touched her as he bent and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you&mdash;!&rdquo; a little cry of doubt and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, mother.&rdquo; The words laughed to her quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out a hand. &ldquo;How long can you stay?&rdquo; She was stroking
      his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;?&rdquo; The hand pushed him from her. The eyes scanned
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; he repeated cheerfully, &ldquo;if you want me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you. I wrote you I was&mdash;happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You wrote it too often&mdash;and too hard.&rdquo; He was
      smiling at her. But the lamps were misty. &ldquo;Did you think I would n&rsquo;t
      see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear&mdash;dear, dear!&rdquo; It was a little
      wail of reproach at his foolishness&mdash;and hers. &ldquo;And you were
      doing so well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do better here. What&rsquo;s burning!&rdquo; He sniffed a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced anxiously toward the kitchen. &ldquo;Your father put some
      crusts in the oven to brown. It can&rsquo;t he&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be anything else,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came back he told her of the great Dr. Blake.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence while the room drew dark about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then she reached out and touched his coat softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow then&mdash;!&rdquo; half-doubtfully, when he bade her good
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow we shall see the great doctor,&rdquo; he assented
      cheerfully. &ldquo;Good night, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, my son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great doctor looked her over keenly, with eyes that saw everything and
      saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little trouble in walking!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nervous sometimes&mdash;a little!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have been a neighbor, inquiring after her health. The little
      woman forgot herself and her fear of him. She told him, very simply, of
      the long nights&mdash;when the walls seemed closing in and there was no
      air except under the sky, and her feet refused to carry her. The line
      between her eyes grew deeper as she talked, but the hands in her lap were
      very quiet. She did not shrink while the doctor&rsquo;s sensitive fingers
      traveled up and down her spine with almost roseleaf touch. Only once she
      gave a quick cry of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. I see. A little tender.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It was almost a gasp, with a quick drawing in of the
      lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;Yes. That will do&mdash;very
      nicely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her away to another room&mdash;to rest a little before the journey.
      When he returned his glance met the boy&rsquo;s absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arranged trifles on his desk&mdash;paperweight and pens and blotter&mdash;as
      affairs of importance, before he spoke, casually:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will always be ill&mdash;Yes. It is a hopeless case&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;
      He paused a little between the words, giving the boy time. &ldquo;She will
      suffer&mdash;more than she has yet. But we can help a little.&rdquo; He
      had drawn a paper toward him and was writing his hieroglyphics with slow
      care, not looking up. &ldquo;We will ease it, all we can. Keep her mind at
      rest. Make her happy.&rdquo; He turned his spectacles on the young man.
      &ldquo;You can make her happy. That will do more for her than I can....
      Will she live? Yes, yes. Longer than the rest, perhaps.... Shall you tell
      her?&mdash;not today, I think&mdash;some other time. She is a little
      tired. She is a brave woman.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IMEON Tetlow
      glanced up sharply. The door had opened without a sound. &ldquo;You
      &rsquo;ve come. Umph!&rdquo; He shoved the pile of letters from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was full of sunshine. Even in the dingy office it glinted and
      shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across its radiance Simeon studied the dull face. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the boy met his, half-wistfully, it seemed. &ldquo;She needs
      me, sir,&rdquo; he said. Simeon stirred uneasily. &ldquo;Seen Dr. Blake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. He says he cannot help her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; Simeon shifted again in his chair. His eye dropped to
      the pile of papers beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s hands had reached out to them. Almost instinctively the
      fingers were threading their way among them, sorting and arranging in neat
      piles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon watched the fingers jealously. It was as if he might spring upon
      them and fasten them there forever. The young man&rsquo;s eyes traveled
      about the room, noting signs of disorder. &ldquo;I can stay today,&rdquo;
      he said slowly. He hesitated. &ldquo;I can stay a week, sir, if you want
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you a week.&rdquo; The man was looking at him
      savagely. &ldquo;You must bring them here!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded. &ldquo;They can live here as well as anywhere!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy pondered it a minute. He shook his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would n&rsquo;t be happy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She has
      friends there, in Bridgewater&mdash;people she&rsquo;s known ever since
      she was a little girl&mdash;and father has his work. He &rsquo;s an old
      man. It would n&rsquo;t be easy for him to get work here. He has an easy
      job&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work enough here,&rdquo; growled Simeon. He was studying the boy&rsquo;s
      face keenly. Was it possible the fellow was making capital of all this? He
      threw off the thought. &ldquo;Work enough here,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      John considered it again. He looked up. The lamps threw their clear light
      into the future. &ldquo;I &rsquo;d thought of that, sir,&rdquo; he said
      slowly, &ldquo;and I &rsquo;ve talked about it&mdash;a little. But I saw
      it hurt them. So I dropped it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re missing the chance of a lifetime,&rdquo; said Simeon.
      &ldquo;There are men working below that&rsquo;d give ten years off their
      life to get what you&rsquo;ve got without trying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s quiet eye met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you &rsquo;ve tried&mdash;you&rsquo;ve tried. I don&rsquo;t
      mean that,&rdquo; he said testily. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a case of fitness&mdash;the
      chance of a lifetime,&rdquo; he repeated significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked at him. &ldquo;I know it, sir. I&rsquo;ve thought about it
      a long time. It &rsquo;s hard to do. But, you see, we never have but one
      father and mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other met it, blinking. &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try to get something at the Bridgewater office. I thought
      perhaps you would recommend me if there was a vacancy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is n&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; said Simeon shortly&mdash;almost
      with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second shipping-clerk left week before last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon turned vaguely toward the pigeonholes. The boy&rsquo;s quick eye
      was before him. &ldquo;This is the one, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon smiled grimly. He drew out a blank from its place and filled it in.
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he said, holding the pen in his
      teeth while he reached for the blotter. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s heavy lifting,
      and Simpson &rsquo;s no angel to work under. No chance to rise, either.&rdquo;
      He was glaring at the boy, a kind of desperate affection growing in his
      eyes..
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy returned the look mistily. &ldquo;You make it a little hard, sir.
      I wish I could stay.&rdquo; He half held out his hand and drew it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon ignored it. He had taken down a ledger and picked a letter from the
      pile before him. The interview was over. The President of the &ldquo;R.
      and Q.&rdquo; Railroad was not hanging on anybody&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s the other ledger, sir,&rdquo; said John quickly,
      &ldquo;the farther one.&rdquo; He reached over and laid it deftly before
      his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon pushed it from him savagely. &ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy went, shutting the door quietly behind him.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was six o&rsquo;clock&mdash;the
      close of a perfect June day. Not even the freight engines, pulling and
      hauling up and down the yard, with their puffs of black smoke, could
      darken the sky. Over in the meadow, beyond the network of tracks, the
      bobolinks had been tumbling and bubbling all day. It was time to close
      shop now, and they had subsided into the long grass. In the office the
      assistant shipping-clerk was finishing the last bill of lading. He put it
      to one side and looked at his watch. A look of relief crossed his face as
      he replaced it and climbed down from the high stool. It had been a hard
      day in the Bridge-water freight-office. News had come, in the early
      morning, of a wreck, three miles down the track&mdash;a sleeper and a
      freight had collided where the road curves by the stonework of the long
      bridge, and John had been sent down to help in looking after the freight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the worst wrecks the road had known. No one placed the
      blame. Those on the ground were too busy to have theories; and those at a
      distance had to change their theories a dozen times during the day. At
      noon word came that the president of the road was on his way to the scene
      of the accident. The news reached John as he was getting into the
      wrecking-car to return to the office. He paused for a flying minute, one
      foot on the step of the car. Then he swung off, and the car moved on
      without him. He spent the next half hour going over the ground. He made
      careful notes of every detail, recalling points from memory, taking
      measurements, jotting down facts and figures with his swift, short
      fingers. When he had finished he took the next wrecking-car back, making
      up for lost time by lunching at his desk while he worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the afternoon he had been doing the work of three men.... Six o&rsquo;clock.
      He got down from the high stool, stretching himself and rubbing his arms.
      In ten minutes the special would pass. He glanced out through the office
      window at the back of the building. High at the top of the sandy bank a
      bunch of clover bloomed against the sky, huge heads, with pink-and-white
      hearts&mdash;a kind of alfalfa&mdash;perhaps a seed from some passing
      freight. He had seen them, flaunting there, between hurried snatches of
      work, all the afternoon. He would pick them and carry them to her. But not
      now.... He looked again at his watch. He wanted to see the special when it
      passed. It would not stop, probably, but he might catch a glimpse of
      Simeon Tetlow. He had often wished he might see him, and he had often
      thought of his face the morning he said good-by. Beneath the anger in it
      had been something the boy could not fathom&mdash;a kind of entreaty....
      He must find some way to give him the notes he had made of the wreck. He
      stepped out on the platform, looking up and down the shine on the tracks.
      The sun, coming low across the meadow beyond the tracks, made everything
      beautiful. A whistle sounded. The special&mdash;at the upper bridge. In
      five minutes it would pass. A smile curved his lips. The sound of quick
      bells and puffs and wheels came pleasantly to him from the engines at work
      in the yard down beyond the freight-house. A long train at the left was
      backing in slowly. John watched it and jingled some pennies in his
      pockets. He was thinking of Simeon Tetlow, the smile still on his lips....
      Suddenly the smile stopped. The fingers gripped the pennies and
      held them fast.. .. His eye flashed along the top of the slow-moving
      train.&mdash;No one in sight&mdash;level tracks&mdash;the special two
      minutes off&mdash;the freight taking her track.... The switch, if he could
      make it&mdash;It was not a thought, but a swift turn of the short legs.
      Never had they seemed to him so fat and heavy beneath him. Yet they were
      flying over the ties as the wind sweeps a field. The short, strong body
      dropped itself upon the switch and hung there, gripping&mdash;a whirl of
      cinders and blast and roar. ... Had he come fast enough?... Ages passed.
      He lifted his head and looked back up the long tracks. The freight was
      still backing in slowly. The special&mdash;like an old lady who has taken
      the wrong crossing&mdash;was emitting a sound of dismay, a quick, high
      note. The wheels reversed and she came back, puffing and complaining, in
      little jerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train halted Simeon Tetlow stepped down from the platform. His
      hand, as it left the iron rail, trembled a little. He thrust it into the
      pocket of his light coat, looking up and down the tracks with stern
      glance. The glance fell upon John mopping his brow.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The president of the road moved toward him slowly. &ldquo;What &rsquo;s
      up?&rdquo; It was short and sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited a minute while he mopped his brow again and replaced the
      handkerchief. He was thinking fast&mdash;for two. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted
      to see you, sir.&rdquo; One glance at the man had told him everything&mdash;the
      shaking hand clinched in the pocket, the quivering nerves, the dusty
      journey, the anxiety and fierce need of help. One more shock and the
      tension would give way. &ldquo;I wanted to see you, sir,&rdquo; he
      repeated quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon was looking at him keenly, up and down. &ldquo;So you stopped my
      special?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I stopped it&mdash;I guess I stopped it.&rdquo;
      His voice almost laughed at the words. He was tugging at something in his
      pocket. &ldquo;I wanted to give you these, sir.&rdquo; He had fished out
      the handful of papers&mdash;old envelopes, scraps, bits of newspaper
      margins&mdash;covered with writing and figures. &ldquo;I was down there
      this morning&mdash;to the wreck,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Things
      were pretty well mixed up&mdash;I thought you might like to see how they
      lay. I made some notes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; It was a long-drawn breath-something between a snarl
      and a laugh. &ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the special, with her hideous decorations of plush and
      imitation leather. The president nodded to the seat beside a table covered
      with telegrams and newspapers and memoranda: &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself opposite the boy, his elbow on the table and his head
      resting on the hand. Beneath its shelter his swift eyes looked out,
      scanning the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; It was sharp and quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled at the familiar note. He ran over the papers in his
      fingers, selecting one near the bottom. &ldquo;This is the way things lay
      when we got there. We were first on the ground. I had a good chance to
      see,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo; Simeon growled a little, leaning toward
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy moved nearer to him. &ldquo;These are the sleepers&mdash;the
      freight lay this way, over to the left. They must have struck just as the
      last car left the bridge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Simeon reached out a hand for the paper. It trembled
      mistily as he bent above it. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; The tone held a note of
      satisfaction. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; He looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was sorting the papers, a half-smile on his slow lips. A sense of
      happiness held his stubby fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president&rsquo;s eyes rested on the dull face for a long minute. His
      hand, holding the paper, had ceased to tremble. He was resting in the
      strength of this body, short and sturdy and full of willing life. No one
      knew what that stubby-fingered boy had meant to him&mdash;what plans for
      the future had been cut off. The boy was to have been closer than a
      partner for him, closer than his own body, through the years. He was to
      have lived with him&mdash;shared his fortune, good and bad.... No one had
      guessed. He himself had not quite known&mdash;until, one day, the door
      closed behind the boy and he found himself sitting before a desk, trying
      with trembling fingers to make an entry in the ledger.... He had worried
      along since then as best he could.... And now he was sitting in the quiet
      car with the boy opposite him. The freight outside was pulling away with
      slow, disturbed puffs. The low sun shone through the car, and a glow of
      red plush lifted itself about them and filled the car with clear, rosy
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up. His eyes met the watching ones, and a quick light
      flashed into them, touching the lamps of service to flame. &ldquo;This is
      the next one, sir.&rdquo; He looked down again at the papers and held one
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president pushed it aside with a touch. His eyes searched the boy&rsquo;s
      face. &ldquo;Tell me what happened&mdash;just now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now&mdash;!&rdquo; The boy looked up, waiting, his lips half
      apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president nodded. &ldquo;You know&mdash;When we stopped&mdash;What was
      wrong!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy waited a minute. &ldquo;No. 39 had your track,&rdquo; he said at
      last, quietly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone now. That&rsquo;s her whistle&mdash;up
      the yard.&rdquo; He turned his head a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president&rsquo;s eyes still scanned the dull face. &ldquo;And you
      changed the switch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The president pushed the papers farther from him, making a place for both
      arms on the table. He leaned forward a little. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what
      you left me for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up, startled. &ldquo;What, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The president nodded slowly. &ldquo;To turn a switch, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
      The thin hand lifted to his lips was trembling now as a leaf quivers at a
      sudden wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one else would have seen,&rdquo; said the boy quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody sees&mdash;but you.&rdquo; He crunched out the words.
      &ldquo;When are you coming back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the office&mdash;I need you.&rdquo; He gulped a little over the
      words. He had never said as much to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamps, with their still glow, were turned toward him. &ldquo;I want to
      come, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked it over last night&mdash;She wants me to do it&mdash;She
      will come with me&mdash;But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the road was looking down now&mdash;waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s eyes studied the worn face with its wrinkles, the thin,
      hard lips and stern lines. Something in it made his heart suddenly go from
      him. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m coming, sir,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face did not look up. It worked strangely for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it dropped in the folded arms on the table and rested there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy fell to sorting the telegrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the man looked up the face was quiet. But something had gone from it&mdash;a
      kind of hard selfishness. The gentleness that touched the lines had left
      them free. He smiled a little wistfully as he held out his hand for the
      papers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now. Go ahead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes the papers were all in his hands, and the special was on
      her way to the wreck. The boy watched it out of sight. Then he turned away
      and crossed the tracks to the sandy bank, whistling softly&mdash;little
      breaths of sound that broke into lightest bubbles of joy as he climbed the
      bank. He was going to gather the clover blossoms, with the pink-and-white
      hearts, to carry home to her.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he man at work in
      the garden looked up with sudden interest. A light whistle had caught his
      ear&mdash;&ldquo;That you, Johnny?&rdquo; He looked out through the vista
      of currant-bushes and peas to the path that skirted the house. &ldquo;You
      there?&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth, who had come around the corner, nodded casually. &ldquo;How is
      mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man got slowly to his feet, rubbing his knees a little. &ldquo;All
      right, I guess. She was out here with me a while ago, but I took her in.&mdash;You
      got some flowers for her?&rdquo; He glanced at the pink-and-white blossoms
      in the boy&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got them on the bank by the track&mdash;Has she had a good day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Putty good, I reckon. Putty good.&rdquo; He was coming down between
      the peas, limping a little. &ldquo;They found out who&rsquo;s to blame&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was moving toward the house, but he turned back with a little
      gesture of silence. &ldquo;She does n&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older man looked a little guilty. &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;fact is&mdash;I
      told her. She kind o&rsquo; got it out o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he added in
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled. &ldquo;She always gets it out of you.&mdash;Never mind if
      it has n&rsquo;t hurt her.&rdquo; He turned again toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very quiet as he entered the room. The blinds were closed and the
      little light that came through the shutters made a kind of cool dusk. He
      crossed to the lounge and laid the flowers by her hand. The delicate
      fingers reached out and closed over them. &ldquo;Clover blossoms,&rdquo;
      she said softly. &ldquo;I was wishing today&mdash;We used to have them in
      the yard-before the lawn-mower&mdash;&rdquo; The fingers strayed here and
      there, touching them gently. &ldquo;Are they crimson?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess again.&rdquo; His voice was full of gentle love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not crimson, no.... But they &rsquo;re not white, either&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you &rsquo;re warm,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes flashed open and looked at him. &ldquo;What happened today?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father told you&mdash;about the accident?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accident&mdash;Yes. But there was something else&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed quietly. &ldquo;You always know, don&rsquo;t you! Was it good
      or bad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a second. &ldquo;Good&mdash;for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for all of us, mother.&rdquo; He bent toward her. &ldquo;We
      were talking about it last night&mdash;about my going back&mdash;if he
      wanted me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Have you heard from him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Today!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;He came down to look after the accident, and his train
      stopped a minute at the office. He wants me&mdash;I think he needs me&mdash;But
      it &rsquo;s for you to say, mother&mdash;you and father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The breath of a sigh came to her lips and changed to a smile. &ldquo;Ah,
      if you can get your father to go&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled back, his eyes searching her face for the slightest shadow that
      should cross it. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said decisively.
      &ldquo;And he &rsquo;ll like it&mdash;after we get there. But will <i>you</i>
      like it, mother! That &rsquo;s what I &rsquo;m afraid of&mdash;You &rsquo;ll
      miss your friends&mdash;and little things&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have you,&rdquo; she returned quickly, &ldquo;and your
      father&mdash;and President Tetlow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled a little at the picture. But his face had suddenly cleared.
      &ldquo;I believe you <i>would</i> like him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never
      thought before how much alike you are&mdash;you two&mdash;in some ways!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed out. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a terrible hard man to get on with!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent and kissed her cheek lightly. &ldquo;For other people, perhaps&mdash;not
      for you&mdash;or me.&rdquo; She had lifted the clovers and was looking at
      them. &ldquo;How beautiful they are!&rdquo; she said softly. They dropped
      again to her side. &ldquo;I want to go.&rdquo; She was looking at him with
      clear eyes. &ldquo;And I want <i>you</i> to go&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see
      how it was when we talked it over last winter&mdash;how much it would mean
      to you. I dreaded the change and your father is so hard to move&mdash;and
      I thought, too, that it would be too much for you&mdash;having me to look
      after and all the responsibility besides. I did n&rsquo;t see then&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it months now, lying here. You really liked
      the work there and that made it easy&mdash;&rdquo; She was looking at him
      inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded slowly. &ldquo;I liked it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I ever did
      any work I liked so well. It was almost as if I thought things out myself.
      I can&rsquo;t explain how it felt&mdash;but somehow I used to forget,
      almost, that I was n&rsquo;t planning things&mdash;It seemed so natural to
      do them&mdash;the things he wanted done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She sighed softly. &ldquo;How he must miss you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed not to have heard her. He was following his thought, clearing it
      to his slow mind. &ldquo;You &rsquo;re right in the midst of things down
      there. It&rsquo;s like being fireman on one of these big engines, I guess&mdash;every
      shovelful you put in, you can see her fly just as if you were doing it
      yourself. Here it &rsquo;s different, somehow. I do first one thing and
      then another, but nothing seems to count much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s like being a brakeman,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I never thought of that! But I&rsquo;ve always
      said I&rsquo;d rather be fireman on any old engine than a high-class
      brakeman&mdash;Pullman or anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the little breath of a sigh that changed quickly to a smile. &ldquo;We
      won&rsquo;t be brakemen any more,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We &rsquo;ll go
      live on the engine&mdash;right by the throttle&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you
      call it, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; A little laugh covered the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent and kissed her again. &ldquo;Dear mother! You shall never go if
      you do not want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I want it&mdash;more than anything in the world. But there
      is your father&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is father,&rdquo; he said decisively. &ldquo;But first we
      &rsquo;ll have supper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out into the kitchen and she lay in the half-dusk with the flowers
      clasped in her fingers. Presently she lifted them and drew them across her
      cheek. &ldquo;It was good in You to make flowers,&rdquo; she said softly,
      &ldquo;thank You for them. ... Thank You....&rdquo; The words trailed away
      to a breath as she held the flowers to the light, turning them a little
      and shaking them softly apart to look into their cool fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she touched them again to her cheek and lay with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boy came in a few minutes later, he stood for a moment watching
      her before he set the slender glass of water on the table and turned to
      the window, opening the blinds and letting in the late light. Her eyelids
      lifted and she looked out at him dreamily. &ldquo;I must have been asleep,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;I was picking flowers in the meadow at home and the wind
      blew in my face. I ran a little way&mdash;&rdquo; She held out the flowers
      to him. &ldquo;Put them in water for me, John.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took them and shook them apart, dropping them lightly into the glass of
      water on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are drooping,&rdquo; she said regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they will come up.&mdash;Supper is ready.&rdquo; He had
      placed an arm under her shoulders and lifted her from her place as easily
      as if she were a child. They waited a moment while she slipped to her
      feet, steadying herself a little. Then they moved slowly toward the door,
      her weight half resting on the arm that guided her. Any one watching them
      would have seen where the boy had gained his gentle bearing. He leaned a
      little as they went, his soul absorbed in serving her; and something of
      the dignity and courage of the slender shoulders seemed to have passed
      into the heavier ones, as if they, too, bore the burden and the pain with
      heroic spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the old man, waiting by the stove, tea-pot in hand, there was nothing
      heroic in the sight of the two in the doorway. They were simply John and
      Marcia and they had always walked together like that, almost from the time
      John could toddle across the floor. Then her hand had rested on the boy&rsquo;s
      shoulder and he had looked up, now and then, under the weight, saying,
      &ldquo;Does it hurt this way, mother?&rdquo; Now he did not need to ask.
      He guided the slight figure, half carrying it, lightly, as if it had been
      a part of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man set the tea-pot on the table and drew out her chair clumsily.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got lettuce for supper,&rdquo; he said proudly, &ldquo;and
      redishes, and tomorrow night they &rsquo;ll be a mess of peas, if nothin&rsquo;
      happens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into the chair with a little sigh and a smile of pleasure at the
      dainty table. The lettuce lifted itself crisply and the radishes glowed
      pink and white in their dish. A silence fell for a moment on the little
      group. They had never formed the habit of saying grace; but when the
      mother was well enough to be in her place, there was a quiet moment before
      they broke bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at her now, a little shade of anxiety in his face. Then he
      began to talk of the day&rsquo;s happenings, the old man chiming in with
      the odd effect of a heavy freight, shacking back and forth through the
      whirl of traffic. To the boy and his mother talking was a kind of thinking
      aloud&mdash;elliptical flashes, sentences half-finished, nods intercepted
      and smiles running to quick laughs. To the old man it was a slower
      process, broken by spaces of silence, chewing and meditating. Now and then
      he caught at some flying fragment of talk, holding it close&mdash;as to
      near-sighted eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; of moving to Bay-port?&rdquo;
      He asked the question humbly, but with a kind of mild obstinacy that
      checked the flow of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we wanted to ask you, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had raised his voice a little, as if speaking to a person who was
      a little deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sat down his tea-cup and rubbed his finger thoughtfully along
      his chin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve I &rsquo;d better go,&rdquo;
      he said slowly. He shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can go
      nohow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy glanced swiftly at his mother. A little line had fallen between
      her eyes. The slower processes of the man&rsquo;s mind were a nervous
      horror to her quick-moving one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward a little. &ldquo;We want to go, Caleb, because it will
      be better for John,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded imperturbably. &ldquo;Yes, it &rsquo;ll be better for the boy.&rdquo;
      He glanced at him kindly. &ldquo;I know all about it&rsquo;s being better
      for the boy. We talked about it last winter, and if you &rsquo;d made up
      your minds to go then, I would n&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; said a word&mdash;not
      a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will be better now&mdash;easier to go. There is n&rsquo;t
      any other difference from what there was last winter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;s a difference,&rdquo; said the old man slowly.
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t hev my squashes then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have n&rsquo;t got them now,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;They
      won&rsquo;t be ripe for months&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six weeks,&rdquo; interrupted the old man solemnly. &ldquo;They are
      just a-settin &rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can buy squashes in Bayport, Caleb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her mildly. &ldquo;Yes, we can buy &rsquo;em, but will they
      be them squashes!&mdash;You know they won&rsquo;t be, and Johnny knows
      they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His look changed a little to severity. &ldquo;When
      a man&rsquo;s done what I have for them squashes&mdash;Why, I dug that
      ground and I fertilized it, and I&rsquo;ve weeded and watered and fussed
      and tended them all spring, and when a man &rsquo;s done that much, a man
      wants to <i>eat &rsquo;em!</i>&rdquo; It was a long speech for the old
      man, and he chewed in gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up again and saw them shining at him. &ldquo;I want to go,
      Johnny,&rdquo; he said, and his thick lips trembled a little, &ldquo;I
      want to do what&rsquo;s best for you. You know it and your mother knows
      it.&rdquo; He was looking at her humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Caleb, I know.&rdquo; The line had vanished from her eyes.
      Dear old Caleb!&mdash;How slow he was and how right, always, in the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would it do, father, if we had the things sent down to us?&rdquo;
      said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s mouth was open, regarding him mildly. &ldquo;If we had,
      what sent, Johnny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The garden stuff&mdash;peas and beets and squashes and so on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull look lightened. &ldquo;Maybe we could&mdash;and it would seem
      good to eat the same ones we raised, would n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He looked
      at him appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d all like it, and it would be good for mother&mdash;to
      have the things fresh from home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So &rsquo;t would, Johnny. So &rsquo;t would. Who&rsquo;ll we get
      to tend &rsquo;em?&rdquo; The thought puckered his forehead in anxious
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There &rsquo;s Stillwell,&rdquo; said John absently. He was not
      looking at the old man, but at his mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was turned to him with a little smile. &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she
      said, as if he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it has been a long day&mdash;so much has happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will help you to bed,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;and
      then I must go back to the office for a little while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him inquiringly. &ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a little while. The special goes back at eight&mdash;I
      want to tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a swift gesture. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait. Your father will help
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll help her, Sonny. You run right along,&rdquo; said the
      old man kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a little late,&rdquo; said the boy, looking at his watch.
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll have to hurry. But I &rsquo;ll be back before you
      &rsquo;re asleep.&rdquo; With a little nod he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other across the vacant place. &ldquo;I do know how
      you &rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stand it,&rdquo; said the old man slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not mind.&rdquo; She spoke with quick decision, &ldquo;but
      it will be hard for you&mdash;leaving the garden and the place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;ve lived here thirty year,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-one,&rdquo; she responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So &rsquo;t was&mdash;thirty-one last May.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came around and laid a clumsy hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;You want I
      should help you, Marcia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Caleb, I &rsquo;ll sit here a little&mdash;perhaps till the boy
      comes back. I like to look at the garden from here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s glance followed hers. &ldquo;It is putty,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You see how them squashes hev come on since morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She smiled at him in the dim light. &ldquo;Seems&rsquo;s
      if you could most see &rsquo;em grow,&rdquo; said the old man with a
      little sigh. He took up his battered hat. &ldquo;Well, I &rsquo;ll go see
      Stillwell. Like enough he &rsquo;ll be glad to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he was outside of the door, he did not turn toward Stillwell&rsquo;s.
      He went down the garden path instead, stooping now and then to a plant or
      vine, patting the mold with slow fingers. At the end of the garden he
      dropped to his knees, feeling cautiously along the bed that skirted the
      high board fence.... &ldquo;Coming on fine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      hollyhocks is what she wanted most of all.&rdquo; His fingers strayed
      among them, picking off dead leaves, straightening stems and propping them
      with bits of stick. While he worked he talked to himself, a kind of
      mumbling chant, and sometimes he lifted himself a little and looked about
      the garden, much as a muskrat sits upon its haunches and watches the outer
      world for a moment before it dives again to its home. Once he looked up to
      the sky and his fingers ceased their work, his face wore a passive look.
      Kneeling there in the half-light, his big face lifted and the fragrance of
      the garden rising about him, he seemed to wait for something. Then his
      face dropped and his fingers groped again among the plants. By-and-by he
      got to his feet, stamping a little to shake out the stiffness. &ldquo;It
      &rsquo;s better for the boy,&rdquo; he said humbly. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll go
      see Stillwell right off.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he special was
      halting, with little puffs, and the president swung down from the steps.
      He looked about him with a nervous, running glance up and down the
      platform. If the boy were not here, he could not wait....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; He laid his hands on a pair of broad shoulders that
      pushed toward him out of the dusk. &ldquo;I want you&mdash;right off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir, I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; There was a note of joy in
      the voice that warmed the older man&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re ready, are you?&rdquo; He had turned toward the
      steps, with quick motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy laughed a little, hurrying beside him. &ldquo;Not tonight. I must
      wait. There are things&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The president paused, one foot on the step, glaring at him. &ldquo;What
      things&mdash;Telegraph&mdash;&rdquo; He waved a hand toward the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t that.&rdquo; The boy spoke quickly, the puffs from
      the engine driving his words aside. Nothing could seem important except
      that great engine, panting to be off, and the nervous man gripping the
      rail at his side. &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t that, sir. It is my mother and
      the moving. I must see to that first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they &rsquo;re coming, are they?&rdquo; The hand on the rail
      relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The president stepped back to the platform. He made an impatient gesture
      to the engineer and turned to the boy. &ldquo;How long do you want?&rdquo;
      It was the old, sharp tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy smiled, looking at him with shining eyes. &ldquo;We might walk
      up and down,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, walk&mdash;if you want to!&rdquo; growled Simeon. He fell into
      a quick trot, matching the boy&rsquo;s stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are bad down there!&rdquo; He jerked out the words. &ldquo;Damn
      fool work!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fault&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; He nodded toward the maze of
      tracks that stretched away in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomlinson is an old man,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old fool!&rdquo; retorted the other. &ldquo;Must have been asleep&mdash;drunk!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he drinks,&rdquo; said the boy quietly. &ldquo;The
      hours are long&mdash;he &rsquo;s old&mdash;he may have dropped off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll drop off now,&rdquo; said the other grimly, &ldquo;&mdash;way
      off&mdash;How long will it take&mdash;this moving business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy waited a minute. &ldquo;I want to come now, sir, right off&mdash;tomorrow.
      But my mother is not well&mdash;You see we must wait for the right day,
      and there is the house to look out for and my father&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know I need you?&rdquo; said Simeon gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked at him again. It was plain, even in the obscure light, that
      the man was driven.... He had never seen him like this; and he thought
      rapidly. The engine had ceased its puffs, but he felt the great throbbing
      power waiting there behind it. His blood thrilled to it, drifting in his
      veins. To be off with this man&mdash;shaping the course of a world! They
      had come to the end of the platform and he stopped, wiping away the great
      drops that had gathered on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s a hot night,&rdquo; said Simeon testily. &ldquo;Come
      into the car&mdash;get something cool.&rdquo; The tone was almost crafty
      and the boy smiled, shaking his head. &ldquo;Not tonight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the slow, patient underhold had regained its power. He spoke in
      his old, slow fashion, choosing his words with care. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      go tonight, sir. But I &rsquo;ll come the first thing in the morning, if
      that will do. A few days won&rsquo;t matter. The moving can wait till this
      thing is straightened out.&rdquo; He motioned toward the east, where the
      wreck lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had turned and were pacing back toward the engine. Insensibly Simeon&rsquo;s
      gait had slowed to the boy&rsquo;s even tread and his breathing had
      slackened its quick beat. He looked at the great eye blazing toward them
      through the dusk. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not
      till you &rsquo;re good and ready. But I tell you&mdash;I shall dock your
      pay!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy laughed out. &ldquo;I will come tomorrow, sir, if she keeps well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tomorrow!&rdquo; said Simeon. It might have been years from the
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped on to the platform of the car. &ldquo;I can get along without
      you,&rdquo; he said. The train had started and the words rumbled back, out
      of the roar of smoke. But to the boy, standing with his hat in his hand,
      they were an appeal for help, a call from the whirl and rush of the world
      for something that he had to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and went down the street, wondering a little at the
      strangeness of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a radiant night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up to the sky&mdash;the same sky that the man in the garden had
      lifted his face to, a little while ago, kneeling among the plants. But the
      stars were out now, lighting its gloom. The boy thought suddenly of his
      mother&rsquo;s eyes and quickened his pace. She would be waiting for him,
      looking into the dark. He felt a little thrill of pride in her courage.
      ... She would make the sacrifice for him without a murmur. Yet it was not
      for him&mdash;nor for the man who needed him. But behind him&mdash;behind
      them all&mdash;a great hand seemed reaching out to the boy, beckoning him,
      drawing him to his place in the world.

      VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>PEEDING that night
      toward Bayport, through the dark and the stars, Simeon Tetlow&rsquo;s
      thoughts were often on the hoy. He was haunted by the wreck. It was
      shattered glass, and charred wood, and blood everywhere, and trampled
      grass and leaves.... But across the face of the wreck moved the hoy&rsquo;s
      eyes as they had turned to him, following his train into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the boy again, he could do all that he had ever planned&mdash;and
      more. In spite of his harsh words, flung back as the train started, his
      heart was aglow. John was coming back to him and together they could work
      out the plan that held him.... He could not have told the plan to any one;
      it was hardly articulate, even to himself. He paced up and down the tawdry
      car, his hands, tense at his sides, opening and closing with the swift
      thought that crowded upon him. It had been coming to him through the
      months, while he had groped and wrestled alone. Slowly it had been forming
      deep below&mdash;shaping itself out of life&mdash;a vision of service. And
      today he had seen it stretching before him, unrolling its web of thought
      as the train tracked the fertile country. All day he had looked out upon
      wide fields, scarred and broken by late frosts, on orchards and meadows
      and stretches of plain, half-tilled; and always, in the distance, the
      mountains, filled to the brim with ore. It was a rich country, but
      starved, straitened&mdash;and no one knew better than the President of the
      &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; road the cause of its poverty. Across its length
      and breadth stretched the road&mdash;like a great monster that sprawled,
      sucking its lifeblood. He had known it, always,&mdash;and he had not
      cared. Let the country take care of itself. There was always enough for
      the road&mdash;and for dividends. He had put them off, when they had come
      to him begging better rates&mdash;leniency in bad seasons. There was not a
      farmer, up and down the region, that did not know Simeon Tetlow. He had a
      name among them. &ldquo;The road was not there for its health.&rdquo; They
      knew his face as he said it, and they hated it. As he sped through the
      night, he seemed to feel it closing in upon him&mdash;a cloud of
      malevolence settling upon him from the hills, rising from the valleys,
      shutting in on every side&mdash;and he, alone in its midst, tracking the
      great country&mdash;his hand reaching out to grasp its wealth.... But not
      now. He had seen it in the slow days that lay behind&mdash;a new vision.
      Sitting alone in his high office, he had watched the great system
      stretching out&mdash;not to drain the wealth of the country, not the huge
      monster that battened on its strength, but a vital necessity&mdash;a thing
      of veins and arteries, the highway of its life current&mdash;without which
      life itself must cease altogether or run feeble and clogged. The great
      imagination that could think a railroad into existence had brooded on the
      picture, sitting alone in its high office, watching the system stretching
      away, branching in every direction, lighting up the surrounding hills. And
      today, when the Boy had said he would come back, the man had known that
      the picture would come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter had brought in his supper, placing it noiselessly before him on
      the table, but the president of the road had pushed it from him, leaning a
      little forward, gazing at the picture that glowed and filled the horizon.
      He drew his hand hastily across his eyes and the porter moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper, sah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo; But he did not stir. His eyes were fixed on
      the dark window, staring into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter reached out a hand to draw down the blind, but the president
      stayed him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it he, Sam. I am ready now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate with quick, nervous motion, his eyes still on the window. Glimmers
      of light from the hills struck across it&mdash;towns glinted and sparkled
      and slipped into the night. The eyes followed them eagerly&mdash;each
      gleam of light, each flash of power. It was a new country&mdash;<i>his</i>
      country. It should Be what he chose to make it&mdash;a fertile land.

      The supper had been removed and the porter had set down the box of cigars
      on the table and withdrawn to his own place. The train rumbled through the
      night with swift shrieks and long, sliding rushes of sound. The president
      of the road reached out for a cigar. But the hand that held the lighted
      match trembled and whirred. He threw it aside, with an impatient sound,
      and struck another, taking the light with quick, tense puffs. It caught
      the spark and glowed. He dropped the match upon its tray. There was a look
      in his eyes that was half fear. He had been a man of iron&mdash;but the
      iron was shaken, shattered.... They threw the worn-out engine on the
      scrap-heap.... But not yet&mdash;Give him a year, two years, to make the
      dream come true. He saw the country bud and blossom and fling its promise
      on the air. In the ground he heard the grass grow, creeping. The grain
      beneath the mold could not move its silken filaments so lightly that his
      ear did not catch the sound; and from the mountains the ore called, loud
      and free, knocking against its walls. The mountains opened their great
      sides, and it poured down into the valleys&mdash;wealth for all the world&mdash;It
      should come true.... Time and strength&mdash;and John!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigar had gone out and he tossed it aside, throwing himself on the red
      cushions and staring at the ceiling that swayed to the swift run of the
      engine. Then he closed his eyes and the boy&rsquo;s face was before him,
      smiling. He slept fitfully. The train rumbled and jarred through his
      sleep, but always with its song of iron courage.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE were no
      dreams in the eyes of the President of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; road
      the next morning. The office was a chaos of papers; they lay on the desk
      and on chairs, and covered the floor. &ldquo;When John opened the door and
      stepped in, the president was running distracted fingers through his hair
      and diving into the chaos. He came up with a grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d find that statement the C. B. and L. sent last
      month&mdash;and be quick about it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smile the boy hung up his hat and went down on his knees into the
      chaos, filing, selecting, discarding, with the old care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon returned to his desk, growling. He took up the telephone receiver
      and put it to his ear, his scowl alert for blunders.... &ldquo;What?&mdash;No!&mdash;You
      &rsquo;ve copied that wrong&mdash;The <i>last</i> one&mdash;yes.... Tom<i>lin</i>son,
      I said&mdash;not Thompson&mdash;Oh, Lord! <i>Tomlin&mdash;L-i-n</i>...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John slipped quietly from the room. At the door marked with the bronze
      token, &ldquo;President&rsquo;s Office,&rdquo; he paused. The typewriters
      clattered merrily within and through the ground glass he caught a haze of
      pompadours rising against the light. He opened the door and looked in. The
      young women at the typewriters did not look up&mdash;except with their
      shoulders. The one by the large window scowled fixedly at her machine, her
      fingers fidgeting and thumping the keys. Her mouth wore a look of fine
      scorn and her blue eyes glinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      John returned to the outer office. The head bookkeeper looked up with a
      nod. &ldquo;Morning, John. Moving along up above!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded a slow reply. &ldquo;Where is Edith?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Edith?&rdquo; The man thought a moment with pen suspended.
      The light from the hanging bulb fell on his lined face. &ldquo;Edith? Oh,
      yes. Congdon took her. Billing-room, I guess. Back to stay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for long.&rdquo; The boy had disappeared through the swinging
      door at the end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man seated at another desk in the room followed him with curious
      glance. &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; he asked, turning a little on his stool
      and staring at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head bookkeeper nodded absently. &ldquo;That is John Bennett.&rdquo;
      His finger was on the column, tracing a blunder to its source.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who in hell is John Bennett?&rdquo; demanded the other slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;ll find out&mdash;if you stay long enough,&rdquo;
      replied the head bookkeeper pleasantly. He placed his finger on the column
      and jotted figures on the little pad at his side. He laid aside the pad.
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;s Simeon Tetlow&rsquo;s shadow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
      two Bridgewater boys over there by the window.&rdquo; He nodded his head.
      &ldquo;They call him &rsquo;Sissie Johnny.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like a fool and acts like Lord of Creation,&rdquo; muttered
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;s what he is,&rdquo; said the head bookkeeper. He had
      no time for conversation just then. He was close on the track of his
      mistake. Moreover, the assistant bookkeeper was a thorn in his side. The
      appointment had been none of his&mdash;one of old man Tetlow&rsquo;s
      blunders, he called it savagely when he had time to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant bookkeeper took up his pen, looking at it musingly. He knew,
      perhaps better than the head bookkeeper, to what he owed his appointment.
      Six months ago he had been in the employ of the rival road. Just why he
      had left them was his own affair, as were also the wires that had been
      pulled in his behalf along the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; Well, he was here.
      He had gathered much interesting information in his six months&mdash;information
      that might be valuable&mdash;very valuable&mdash;some day. He dipped his
      pen in the ink.... As for this John Bennett.... The pens were both at work
      now, flying fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want Edith?&rdquo; Congdon, the head billing-clerk, looked up
      from his file of bills with a little scowl; it changed slowly to pleasure.
      &ldquo;Why, how are you, John? Did n&rsquo;t know you were back... Edith&mdash;Well,
      yes, I took her&mdash;wanted another hand here. Marshall said they could
      spare one from the office. So I took the littlest.&rdquo; He smiled
      genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Littlest and best,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed out. &ldquo;I began to suspect it&mdash;The old man
      wants her back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Congdon turned a little in his place. &ldquo;Oh, Edith!&rdquo; He raised
      his voice and the girl across the room looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He beckoned to her and she came slowly, leaving her machine with a little
      touch that was almost a pat, as if it said, &ldquo;Coming back very soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; She stood before them waiting, a slight, dark
      girl, with clear glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s eyes dwelt on her kindly. &ldquo;They
      want you back in the office, Edith. You need n&rsquo;t stop to finish.&mdash;I
      &rsquo;ll put some one else on those.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away with a look that was almost a smile of pleasure. Half way
      to her table she paused and came back. &ldquo;I can take my machine, can&rsquo;t
      I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed tolerantly. &ldquo;Oh, take it along, if you want to&mdash;Nobody
      else wants it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John followed her to the table. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll carry it for you,
      Edith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped out the paper she had been at work on and began gathering up
      the trifles from her table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he set down the machine in the president&rsquo;s office, a ripple of
      eyebrows passed it by&mdash;glances too busy for comment. The clatter of
      the typewriters rose and hummed. The hive could not pause for a worker
      more or less. She slipped into her place with a little smile and nod,
      waiting while John shifted the telephone connection and swung a bulb, with
      its green shade, conveniently in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little bell rang sharply and she leaned to the receiver. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John crossed to the young woman by the window. She had finished a sheet
      and was drawing it out with a quick swirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All done?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ignored him, rubbing out an offending word and blowing away the black
      fuzz before she looked up. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said sharply. Her
      hair, which was red and crisp, glinted as she turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes followed it with a little look of pleasure. There was
      something about that color that always made him happy. He did not know
      this and it had never occurred to him to be diplomatic. But a hint of a
      smile crossed the girl&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; She was looking at him tolerantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a sheaf of papers from his pocket. &ldquo;These are to be copied&mdash;leaving
      blanks here, and here&mdash;Send a boy when they are done. He wants two
      carbons&mdash;very clear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; She took them from him with a look of relief. It
      might be an honor to take down &rsquo;the old man&rsquo;s dictation, but
      it was an honor she could dispense with. She fluffed her fingers toward
      the glinting hair and descended on the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stood for a moment, looking thoughtfully at the crisping hair in the
      wide window-light. The girl had turned her head a little and it twinkled,
      but did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crossed the room, he glanced casually at the new occupant. Her head
      was bent to the receiver and a little smile played about her lips. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes?&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
      Her fingers moved quickly and she nodded once or twice as if listening to
      something pleasant. &ldquo;She <i>likes</i> to work for him,&rdquo;
      thought John, &ldquo;same as I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a look of satisfaction on his round face he closed the office door
      behind him. He had accomplished, without a jar, what perhaps no other man
      in the service could have done. But he was not thinking of this&mdash;he
      hardly knew it. He was planning what Simeon should have for luncheon&mdash;something
      hot and staying....
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out a hand to a boy who was hurrying toward the elevator.
      &ldquo;Hold up, Sandy. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A note for the president.&rdquo; It was the tone of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled a little as he held out his hand. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll take it
      to him&mdash;and here&mdash;&rdquo; The hoy&rsquo;s face had fallen,
      &ldquo;Take this&mdash;&rdquo; He wrote hastily on a pad&mdash;&ldquo;Carry
      that, one o&rsquo;clock sharp, to the Holman House. They &rsquo;ll give
      you a luncheon for the president. Sprint, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet.&rdquo; The smile was stealing back to the boyish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded. &ldquo;Bring it up yourself&mdash;set it on the box by the
      door&mdash;not later than one, mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded and was gone, tucking the note in his pocket. It did not
      occur to him to question the authority of this slow-moving young man&mdash;hardly
      more than a boy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to any one to question it, as he made his way in a sort
      of slow-looking, fast fashion about the building, doing the things, little
      and big, that came to his hand. One did not think of the boy apart from
      his eyes. It was as if a spirit dwelt there, guiding the slowness and
      sureness, and men yielded to it, as they yield to the light when it shines
      on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the boy had known his power or guessed it, it would have vanished,
      slipped from him, even while he put out his hand to it. But he had always
      been slow and stupid&mdash;not clever like other boys&mdash;and needing
      time and patience for his work. He knew that it rested his mother to have
      him do things for her, and that Simeon Tetlow needed him. Beyond that his
      mind did not travel. He could not have told how he knew men&rsquo;s
      thoughts&mdash;read their minds, almost, when their eyes looked into his&mdash;any
      more than he could have told why certain colors made him happy, or why he
      had chosen Edith Burton out of the office force for Simeon&rsquo;s private
      work. Things came to him slowly. He stood motionless, sometimes, waiting&mdash;almost
      stupidly, it seemed&mdash;before a piece of work, a decision to be made&mdash;but
      when he put out his hand to it, he held it with firm grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon did not look up when he came back. He was speaking into the
      telephone, a look of comparative peace on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      John swept aside the heap of bills and memoranda that covered the desk
      across the room. Then he looked about for the dust-cloth. He found it in
      the pocket of one of Simeon&rsquo;s old coats on the wall. A piece of
      cheese fell to the floor as he shook it out. And Simeon, looking around as
      he hung up the receiver, smiled for the first time in weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that &rsquo;s where I put that cheese, is it? I got it one day
      for luncheon&mdash;forgot where I put it&mdash;did n&rsquo;t have any
      luncheon that day at all.&rdquo; He was looking at it regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      John tossed it into the waste basket, a look of disapproval in his face.
      He wiped the dust from his desk, arranging the files of papers he had
      collected from the floor and placing them in pigeon-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon watched, a look of something like contentment creeping to his face.
      &ldquo;You found that statement yet?&rdquo; The question was almost mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; John picked up the paper and handed it to him.
      &ldquo;They &rsquo;ve made double charge on those forty boilers, have n&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo; Simeon took it and glared at it. &ldquo;That &rsquo;s what I
      can&rsquo;t find out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find out.&rdquo;
      He sighed impatiently and laid it on the desk while he reached for another
      set of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, watching the face, was struck anew by the weariness in it. It was
      the face of an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. &ldquo;Suppose I take it, sir. I &rsquo;ll be down
      in the yard this afternoon and I &rsquo;ll look it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of jingling glass outside the partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stepped quickly to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Sandy. Take this to McElwain in the yard. Tell him I &rsquo;ll
      be down in half an hour.&mdash;Here &rsquo;s your luncheon, sir.&rdquo; He
      brought in the tray and placed it on the table, setting a chair before it
      and drawing the cork from the bottle. He removed the napkin that covered
      the tray. &ldquo;Your luncheon &rsquo;s ready, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh of satisfaction, the President of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo;
      Road rose from his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fresh towel, sir, and I brought up some soap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With another sigh, the president of the road obeyed.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>Imeon was looking
      over his mail, grumbling and fussing. He pushed a pile of letters toward
      John when he returned from luncheon. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming in&mdash;thick
      and fast,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damages.&rdquo; He was scowling absently at the sheet in his hand.
      &ldquo;Mail was full of it this morning. Here&rsquo;s another.&rdquo; He
      tossed it to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      John gathered them up, looking at them thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take &rsquo;em to McKinnon,&rdquo; said Simeon. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll
      tend to &rsquo;em for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I read them first?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon snorted a little. &ldquo;Read &rsquo;em?&mdash;Yes, read &rsquo;em,
      if you want to. You won&rsquo;t find them very entertaining. <i>I</i> did
      n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was turning them over slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll pay &rsquo;em&mdash;every just claim,&rdquo; said the
      old man. His shoulders were hunched a little forward, as if he were
      talking to himself. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll pay the just ones&mdash;every last
      cent. But the fakes can look out&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; His jaw
      set itself firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had taken them to his desk and was going through them, making
      notes from them slowly. The heavy look in his face held a kind of pain. He
      was seeing it again&mdash;the wreck&mdash;the flare of fire; there were
      groans about him and shrill calls&mdash;hysterical women&mdash;and there
      had been a child.... He glanced across at Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s face, bent to his work, was gray and haggard. He
      looked up, meeting the boy&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s a terrible thing!&rdquo; he said as if answering the
      look. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get it out of my mind.&rdquo; His hand shook a
      little reaching for the paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give the year&rsquo;s
      profits&mdash;&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have to,&rdquo; said the boy quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrewd business look flashed back to the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You
      can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he said brusquely. &ldquo;We shall settle &rsquo;em
      out of court&mdash;all we can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it cost more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, maybe. Some we &rsquo;ll pay a little more, perhaps, than
      the court would allow. But it &rsquo;s cheaper&mdash;in the end. The
      public won&rsquo;t get scared. It&rsquo;s bad having things gone over and
      raked up for folks to read. Let &rsquo;em sleep. We &rsquo;re ready and
      willing to pay costs&mdash;Keep the thing quiet. It&rsquo;s only the fakes
      that bother&mdash;&rdquo; He gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was staring at the letter in his hand. He put it down and crossed
      to Simeon&rsquo;s desk, taking oat the handful of notes he had made the
      night of the wreck. He ran them through his fingers and replaced them,
      smiling a little. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s tha?&rdquo; asked Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see if I made a note. I don&rsquo;t think I did, but I
      can remember.&rdquo; He went over and picked up the letter again. &ldquo;It
      &rsquo;s this man Spaulding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light shot to Simeon&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I saw him there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did!&rdquo; The light had gone out suddenly. &ldquo;Fight it&mdash;You
      testify in court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was looking down at the letter thoughtfully. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s a
      good thing I asked,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asked what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said the hoy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I did
      it. One of the brakemen told me. He limps a little, does n&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; said Simeon promptly. &ldquo;Rascal!
      Known him thirty years. He could n&rsquo;t tell the straight truth if he
      tried&mdash;no more &rsquo;n he can walk straight.&rdquo; His mouth shut
      grimly. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get a cent out of <i>this</i> road&mdash;not
      while <i>I</i> run it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will,&rdquo; said the boy quietly. &ldquo;He
      was there&mdash;at the wreck. I saw him. But he came in a buggy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buggy?&rdquo; Simeon sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded. &ldquo;And he went away in it.-It was while I was looking
      after the freight&mdash;along toward the end. I had sealed the cars that
      were n&rsquo;t broken up and I was trying to tally odds and ends&mdash;Things
      were scattered, you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s eyes assented gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was down in that gully to the left, looking after things, and I
      came on the horse and buggy tied there&mdash;a little way in from the
      road.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon was smiling now, a look of exultation in his eyes. &ldquo;You saw
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came down and got in while I was there&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a little off in the trees where I was; but I saw him quite
      plainly. It was getting light then&mdash;four o&rsquo;clock, at least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon chuckled. He reached out a hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have his claim&mdash;Twenty
      thousand, is it?&rdquo; He looked at it. &ldquo;Ten cents would buy him&mdash;body
      and soul!&rdquo; he said scornfully. &ldquo;Just like him&mdash;to hear of
      it and drive across country&mdash;five miles&mdash;to get evidence!&rdquo;
      He looked at John shrewdly. &ldquo;Perjury&rsquo;s a good thing&mdash;put
      him where he belongs&mdash;where he &rsquo;ll stay put, too. He won&rsquo;t
      go driving across country, making up claims for damages for quite a spell,
      likely, if he pushes this one.&rdquo; He tapped the paper in his hand.
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand he wants, does he? Let him get it&mdash;work for it&mdash;making
      shoes!&rdquo; He replaced the letter in his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;ll keep that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t
      trouble McKinnon with it&mdash;not just yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his work, a look of satisfaction in his face, and went
      through the remaining letters, laying them one side, making a note for
      reference. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; He placed the last one on its
      pile and gathered up the bunch. &ldquo;There &rsquo;s one thing I &rsquo;ve
      noticed,&rdquo; he said drily, &ldquo;folks that get to handing in their
      claims inside of twenty-four hours ain&rsquo;t very badly damaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up absently. &ldquo;Did you mean this, sir?&rdquo; He had
      picked up a letter from the pile and he brought it across, laying it on
      Simeon&rsquo;s desk. Across one corner of it a note was scrawled in Simeon&rsquo;s
      small, crabbed hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at it with a snort. &ldquo;Why should n&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      John surveyed it thoughtfully. &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know but you would
      like to read it again.&rdquo; Simeon took it in his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      read it a number of times already,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see what it
      means, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He was looking over the top of his glasses
      at the boy&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded. &ldquo;They mean that you will promise to hold to the
      rates of the last two years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t say so&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>means</i> that,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I make out. Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      do it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t promise the C., B. and L. anything. You
      understand?&mdash;not <i>anything!</i>&rdquo; He was glaring at the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He held out a hand. &ldquo;I only wanted to make
      sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon handed him the letter. &ldquo;The C., B. and L. is a big road,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;They &rsquo;ve got smart men, but they can&rsquo;t run the
      &rsquo;R. and Q.&rsquo;&mdash;not yet.&rdquo; He pointed to the words
      scrawled in the corner. &ldquo;You write what I&rsquo;ve marked there. Don&rsquo;t
      let it go downstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy went back to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon wrote with level brows, scowling at the paper before him. By-and-by
      he looked up. The boy, bending over his desk, had a troubled look. The
      president of the road watched him a few minutes in silence. He pushed back
      his papers. &ldquo;Oh, John&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that. It gives them a chance to cut.
      But they&rsquo;ve been doing it all along on the side. I have pretty clear
      proof they carried Thornton &amp; Birdwell last year for six&mdash;five
      and three-quarters, part of the time, and a rebate besides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this means open fight,&rdquo; said the boy. He was looking down
      at the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it &rsquo;s what I want,&rdquo; said Simeon quickly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      had their spies on me long enough. Let &rsquo;em come out and fight for
      what they get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was still looking at the paper, a question in his eyes. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t think they will connect with the Bridgewater terminus?&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon&rsquo;s eyes were on him shrewdly. &ldquo;I think they &rsquo;ll <i>try</i>
      to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they&mdash;do&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they do, they &rsquo;ll find they can&rsquo;t&mdash;not this
      year, nor next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon nodded. &ldquo;You remember telling me last year that the Bardwell
      farm would block their road and that you thought it could be got?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew they needed money,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;They took a fair
      price,&rdquo; said the old man drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s face lighted slowly&mdash;&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t put
      through their road!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without a lot of trouble. They can compel us to sell&mdash;maybe.
      But it will take time&mdash;and it will take a lot of money,&rdquo; he
      said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s face answered the look in his. &ldquo;You going to fight
      &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded slowly. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m going to fight &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
      He touched the letter with his hand. &ldquo;Do you know what that rate
      would mean for the road?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has paid pretty well for two years,&rdquo; said the boy
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it would pay again,&rdquo; said the man. He looked at the boy.
      &ldquo;It would pay three years&mdash;perhaps four&mdash;for the road. But
      it would n&rsquo;t pay the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked at him, a little puzzled light in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon surveyed him a minute. Then he turned away, as if half ashamed.
      &ldquo;What did you find out from McElwain about those boilers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy glanced at the clock. &ldquo;He &rsquo;s to have the statement at
      five. I &rsquo;ll get it now.&rdquo; When he had gone from the room, the
      man sat looking thoughtfully at his desk. He could not understand the
      feeling that had suddenly gripped him&mdash;a kind of shame&mdash;holding
      him back from revealing to the boy his purpose. He had faced the world
      with selfishness, but when virtue tried to look out from his eyes, they
      had faltered and turned away.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ohn went slowly
      down the stairs, pondering the quick words that had been spoken. What did
      it mean? He had never known the President of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo;
      to give a thought for any one or anything&mdash;except the road. He must
      be going to pieces&mdash;talking about the good of the country. ... The
      boy had always felt, in a vague way, the region hating Simeon&mdash;his
      hand against every man and every man&rsquo;s hand against him&mdash;and
      John had been his henchman, serving him faithfully; his quarrels had been
      John&rsquo;s quarrels and his battles John&rsquo;s battles. Again and
      again the boy&rsquo;s heavier hand had steadied his; they had fought to
      win and they had given no quarter. But now.... The boy&rsquo;s brow
      puckered in a little puzzled frown.... Now, Simeon was turning his back on
      profit.... He was bringing on himself difficulties and annoyance&mdash;What
      was up? He shook his head and plunged into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out, he had forgotten his questioning. He held McElwain&rsquo;s
      statement.&mdash;The C., B. and L. account was a clear overcharge&mdash;a
      mistake, perhaps; but it seemed to the boy there had been too many
      mistakes of that kind in his absence; and things were coming to the
      president of the road that should never have troubled him. No wonder he
      looked harassed and driven. But that should be changed now. He should have
      the quiet he needed for his work. The boy&rsquo;s heart glowed and he
      whistled lightly as he sprang up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid the statement before the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president grunted a little&mdash;puffs of smouldering wrath. He
      searched out the C., B. and L. statement, pinning them together with quick
      stab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was gathering up the letters for the mail, licking each stamp and
      affixing it with slow precision in its corner, right side up. It would
      have troubled John&rsquo;s orderly soul had an ex-president gone out of
      the office, standing on his head. In the midst of the work he stopped, his
      eye held by an address on the envelope before him. He opened his mouth and
      glanced at Simeon, hesitating. He drew a stamp across the convenient
      tongue and placed it on the envelope, crowding it down with firm palm, his
      eye still on the address. He looked again at the president and laid the
      letter one side, going on with his stamps. When he had finished, he
      bundled them together, the letter that he had laid aside on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon was making ready to go, fussing a little at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll take care of those,&rdquo; said John. He came across.
      &ldquo;Did you want this to go?&rdquo; He was holding out the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon dropped an eye to it curtly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
      it? It&rsquo;s plain, is n&rsquo;t it&mdash;&lsquo;Hugh Tomlinson,
      Bridgewater&rsquo;?&rdquo; He turned again fretfully to the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy hesitated. &ldquo;I thought it might be his dismissal?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &rsquo;re very poor, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shot a look at him under keen brows. &ldquo;That letter is not
      about their being poor,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John laid it again on the desk. He brought Simeon&rsquo;s hat, brushing it
      a little and holding it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took it brusquely, crowding it on to his head, and moved toward
      the door. He passed the letter without a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, sir,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; It was a half growl, muffled by the closing
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy finished his work in the room. He glanced about; it was all right
      now, except the grime on the windows&mdash;and there must be some sort of
      shade for them these hot days.... Awnings&mdash;? He went to the window
      and leaned out, looking for fastenings.... Yes, that would do. He would
      order them in the morning. His eye dropped to the street. It fell on the
      figure of the president on the opposite side walking slowly and bent like
      an old man. It almost seemed to the boy watching, that the figure shook a
      little, as with a kind of palsy. The boy&rsquo;s eyes grew deep, following
      him out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had turned away, he became conscious that another figure had
      emerged from a doorway somewhere and was standing looking after the
      feeble, retreating one. Then it turned and re-entered the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the window, puzzling a little in his mind, half-wondering where
      he had seen the man before.... He gathered up the letters from the table,
      glancing at them absently.... Then it came to him&mdash;The new
      bookkeeper, Harrington. The president had told him&mdash;The one that had
      taken Carpenter&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, locking the door behind him. The letter on the top he still
      held a little apart from the others, dropping it into the box by itself,
      holding it back to the last, as if hoping somehow to defeat its end. When
      it fell with a little swish upon the others, he turned away hurriedly. He
      was thinking of Ellen&rsquo;s face&mdash;Tomlinson&rsquo;s wife&mdash;the
      morning of the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He done it, Johnny,&rdquo; she had said piteously, wiping the
      wetness from her gray cheek. &ldquo;And they &rsquo;ll turn him off, but
      it&rsquo;s hard on an old man&mdash;and there&rsquo;s not a cent laid by&mdash;not
      since the bairns came. We&rsquo;d a bit before that, but it went for the
      boy&rsquo;s burying&mdash;&rdquo; The boy was Eddie, killed on the road
      the year before, a brakeman&mdash;Tomlinson&rsquo;s only son. John had
      known him well. They had been schoolmates. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard on the
      bairns,&rdquo; she had said.... They had come to live with Tomlinson&mdash;a
      boy and a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was walking slowly now, not thinking, hardly conscious of himself, hut
      feeling the misery in the old woman&rsquo;s voice. At the corner he paused
      a little, staring at the opposite wall. What had he forgotten to do....
      The desks were locked and the door.... His fingers felt the key in his
      pocket.... And the copy was ready for Whitcomb in the morning.... And the
      windows? Yes, they were closed.... But he must go hack. He would remember
      when he got there what it was.... With a little sigh he had turned back.
      He walked more quickly now.... He would measure the windows for the
      awnings. Perhaps that was what he was trying to remember. He sprang up the
      stairs quickly and was on the upper floor almost before there was time for
      thought. His coming had been swift, and perhaps too silent for a man in
      the upper loft who looked up with startled glance at the sound of a foot
      on the stair. He moved quickly from the place he had been standing in and
      met the boy half way in the big room, his glance full of nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stared at him a little. Then his brow raised itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man returned the look, smiling. &ldquo;Jolly old place!&rdquo; he
      said, moving his hand toward the loft, &ldquo;lots of room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked at him slowly. &ldquo;No one comes up here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except the old man. I know,&rdquo; said the other pleasantly,
      &ldquo;but I wanted some files for the morning&mdash;early. Thought I
      &rsquo;d save time getting them now&mdash;Save bothering the old man, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did n&rsquo;t find them, did you?&rdquo; He was looking into
      the man&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They flickered a little. &ldquo;Well, I have n&rsquo;t had time.&rdquo; He
      laughed, easily. &ldquo;I only want a couple of dozen.&rdquo; He moved
      away a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find them here,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &rsquo;re over here,&rdquo; said the man, looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man moved quickly to a box and raised the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hoy looked in with a startled glance. &ldquo;Those belong on the third
      floor,&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about
      that. I &rsquo;m new here.&rdquo; He had taken out a handful of the files
      and closed the box. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t run the business, you know. But I
      know where to find things when I want &rsquo;em.&rdquo; He spoke almost as
      if the last words had escaped without volition. It was a challenge to the
      clear eyes looking into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be moved down tomorrow,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;They
      will be more convenient down there,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the other smoothly. He had
      recovered his temper. &ldquo;Glad to have seen you.&rdquo; He went softly
      down the stairs, with little tripping steps that tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s eyes followed him slowly. He went into the office and
      closed the door behind him. For a long minute he stood looking at Simeon&rsquo;s
      desk. Then he went across to it. He sat down before it and tried the lid.
      It was locked securely, as he had left it. He did not open it, but sat
      motionless, gazing before him. Dusk settled in the room&mdash;shadows
      crept in from the comers. But the boy had not stirred.... At last he
      raised himself with a little sigh. He had come back none too soon. His
      slow, sensitive nature felt things that he could not have said. The
      president needed him&mdash;more than either of them had known! He opened
      the desk deliberately and took out a handful of papers, sorting out
      certain ones with mechanical fingers. Even in the dark he knew them; but
      he turned on the light for a minute to make sure; he selected certain ones
      and placed them together, slipping them into his pocket. Then he turned
      out the little looping bulbs and went out, and left the room to the
      darkness.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next morning a
      new lock was on the office door and the key lay on the president&rsquo;s
      desk when he came in. He glanced at it sharply. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve had a new lock put on; the old one was never very good,&rdquo;
      said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took up the key and slipped it on to his key-ring without comment.
      A hundred times a day the boy did things without consulting him. If he saw
      any special significance in this new caution, his face gave no sign and
      his hand, as it slipped the ring into his pocket, trembled no more than
      usual. But his glance, as it fell on the boy through the day, held a quiet
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how wrong things had been going for the last few weeks only the
      president of the road knew. It seemed almost as if there were a concerted
      plan to harrow him&mdash;some hidden power, that chose maliciously his
      weakest spot, at the moment when he was most off his guard. Yet he could
      never lay his finger on a thing or a person that proved it. He only felt,
      helplessly enmeshed by circumstance&mdash;he, who had always driven
      others, chuckling at their discomfiture! But with the boy to help&mdash;Ah,
      what could he not do&mdash;with the boy! His face lost its driven look.
      The new awnings shaded the glare from the windows. It was almost
      comfortable in the little office.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the boy, he was watching over Simeon with new care. Not only did
      what he had seen the night before make him cautious, but Simeon&rsquo;s
      whole attitude troubled him. There was something about the man&mdash;broken,
      hesitant&mdash;that had never been there before. He had always been
      nervous, crabbed, but not like this. It was as if the spring had snapped&mdash;or
      weakened helplessly under the long strain. One could not tell, at any
      moment, whether it would respond to the demands made on it. Now and then
      he recovered himself and spoke and acted like his old self. But again he
      would relapse into uncertainty, a kind of vague fretfulness and
      indecision, more trying than open collapse. It was when he spoke of the
      road and its future that he grew most like himself. ... Quietly the boy
      took it in&mdash;his change of purpose&mdash;and his heart moved to it in
      gentle understanding. Little by little, Simeon revealed himself&mdash;a
      word here, a word there&mdash;never by full explanation&mdash;watching all
      the time the thought reflected in the boy&rsquo;s eyes, and strengthening
      his courage in the clear look as it grew and deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy threw himself into the work, body and soul. It was good to be in
      the stir of things once more. He liked to feel the steady pound of the
      engine under him, as it drove to its work&mdash;to see the clear track and
      the shining country.... He drew his breath full and deep, and worked night
      and day, righting the things that had gone wrong, gathering details into
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon Tetlow could plan an edifice that in a night should overtop the
      world. But even while he planned, he let slip a myriad details&mdash;things
      that fluttered and fell and went wrong and threatened the structure at its
      proudest foment. The boy gathered them up one by one, little things of no
      account, things too minute for Simeon&rsquo;s notice&mdash;and held them
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office felt the change. The road felt it&mdash;vaguely. There was the
      same driving power in the little office, high up in the roof, but steadied
      and controlled&mdash;less smoke and wrath and ringing of bells in the
      orders that came down from the office and a freer, heavier swing to the
      big engine as it took the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was absorbing work, and two weeks went by before the boy saw a chance
      to break away. There had been letters from his mother every day, full of
      detail&mdash;pictures of Caleb packing the dishes with clumsy fingers, or
      clearing out the cellar, happy and important, in spite of the parting from
      the squashes. John had smiled as he read the letters, but he had caught
      the note of courage beneath and sent it back to her full of cheer.... The
      moving would not be hard&mdash;with all that father had been doing. Three
      days would be enough for everything and he had their new home ready for
      them, a little house&mdash;seven rooms with a garden stretching to the
      side and back, for Caleb to dig in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can raise a few things this year,&rdquo; Caleb had said when he
      heard it&mdash;&ldquo;Lettuce and parsley and reddishes, maybe. And next
      year we &rsquo;ll have a <i>real</i> garden. I&rsquo;m going to take up
      some roots of daffydils and some jonquils and a stalk of that flowering
      shrub by the walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was occupied with this new hope when John arrived&mdash;pottering about
      with hoe and trowel&mdash;and they left him to his garden, while inside
      the house John tied up furniture and packed boxes, with watchful eye upon
      his mother that she should not overtax her strength before the journey.
      She had been a little restless the first day of his homecoming, going from
      room to room with long pauses for rest&mdash;a kind of slow pilgrimage&mdash;touching
      the familiar things softly, her thin hands lingering on them as if she
      might not see them again in the new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy watched a little anxiously. But her face was still and her eyes
      smiling when they met his, and after the first day she sat with him while
      he packed, talking of their new home and his work, and when the carriage
      left the house, she did not look back&mdash;her eyes were on the boy&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been arranged that they should travel in the baggage-car. Simeon
      had spoken gruffly of the special and John had refused it, and she herself
      had chosen the baggage-car. &ldquo;It will interest me, I think,&rdquo;
      she said. There was a free space about her steamer-chair and through the
      partly-open door that framed a great picture a fresh breeze blew in,
      stirring her hair and bringing a clear color to her cheeks. Her eyes were
      like stars, looking out on the fields, and she grew like a child with the
      miles. John&rsquo;s heart lightened as he watched her. What a thing of
      courage she was! Sheer courage. Just a frail body to give it foothold on
      the earth. The boy could not have said it, but he felt it&mdash;through
      every dull fiber&mdash;the courage that he could never match, but that had
      been before every day of life.... He need not have feared the journey for
      her&mdash;She made holiday of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little he left her and went forward. He had seen a man sitting at
      the farther end of the car, bent forward, his elbows resting on his knees,
      his gaze on the floor of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look up as John paused beside him, and the boy seated himself
      on a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he looked up. &ldquo;You &rsquo;re taking her to the Port?&rdquo;
      He nodded toward the steamer-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;re all going down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heerd it,&rdquo; said the man. He relapsed into silence. The
      train thundered on with hoarse stops and fierce quickening of power as it
      left the stations behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man lifted his head. &ldquo;He &rsquo;s a hard man!&rdquo; he said. He
      fixed his reddened eyes on the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve served
      the road&mdash;man and boy&mdash;forty year.&rdquo; He said the words
      slowly, as if they were important. They became a kind of chant in the roar
      of the train&mdash;&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m turned off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited a minute. His slow mind did not find words to speak to the
      haggard face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to see him,&rdquo; said the man.
      &ldquo;The president!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded slowly and solemnly. &ldquo;They say he &rsquo;s a hard man. But
      he shall hear it to his face&mdash;what I &rsquo;ve got to say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re going to ask him for work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve asked it&mdash;three times. I &rsquo;ll ask it four
      times,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;And after that I &rsquo;ll curse him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy made a quick motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old face lifted itself, with a tragic look, toward the car. &ldquo;Is
      there aught a man can do?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;They &rsquo;ve shook
      the strength out of me for forty year on the road.... They &rsquo;ll not
      take it from me! ... They &rsquo;ve drove me up and down&mdash;cold and
      rain&mdash;wind that cut my in&rsquo;ards&mdash;till I &rsquo;m fit for
      naught but the switch.... They &rsquo;ll not take it from me!&rdquo; It
      was a solemn cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy listened to it, for a moment, as it died away. The train roared
      its echo mockingly. He reached out a hand and laid it on the rough knee.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go down today, Tomlinson,&rdquo; he said slowly.
      &ldquo;I want to see him first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared at him with grim eyes. &ldquo;Ye think ye can help me
      with him?&rdquo; he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>know</i> I can. But you must wait. I have my mother to look
      after. I can&rsquo;t be at the office&mdash;yet. Wait till I &rsquo;m
      there. You take the next train back and I &rsquo;ll write you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll not go back,&rdquo; said the old man slowly, &ldquo;I
      &rsquo;ll not face Ellen without news&mdash;good or bad. But I &rsquo;ll
      stop off to my daughter&rsquo;s&mdash;in Hudson. Ye can write me there and
      I &rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll write you before the week &rsquo;s up,&rdquo; said
      John. &ldquo;You may not need to come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank ye, Johnny,&rdquo; said the old man. The train had halted
      at Hudson and he got stiffly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s what Eddie al&rsquo;ays said about you, you &rsquo;d
      help a man out&mdash;gi&rsquo;e you time!&rdquo; He chuckled feebly, with
      returning hope, and climbed down from the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother&rsquo;s glance met him as he returned to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;He was going down to see the president. But I &rsquo;ve
      got him to wait.... They ought to do something for him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he strong enough to work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not strong&mdash;except in an emergency, maybe&mdash;but
      he &rsquo;s faithful. That ought to count.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that ought to count.&rdquo; She said the words softly under
      her breath.

      XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OHN was not back
      at the office &ldquo;within the week.&rdquo; He forgot the office and
      Simeon Tetlow and Tomlinson. He had eyes only for a white face looking up
      to him from the pillow and his ear listened only for low moans that broke
      the darkness. The spirit of courage had driven the thin body a step beyond
      the line where the soul has its way, and the body had turned and struck
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson, waiting in his daughter&rsquo;s home, wondered a little at the
      silence, but waited, on the whole, content. Since his talk with John a
      hope had sprung up in him that, somehow, the boy would do for him what he
      could never do for himself. He had started out for Bayport more because he
      wanted to look Simeon Tetlow in the face than because he hoped for justice
      at his hands. But since he had talked with the hoy, his purpose had
      changed imperceptibly and his shrewd Scotch sense of justice asserted
      itself. He would speak the president of the road fair. The man should have
      his chance. He should not be condemned unheard. So Tomlinson waited, his
      sullen mood passing gently into tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his daughter, a buxom woman, many years Eddie&rsquo;s senior, grew
      impatient at the delay. She prodded Tomlinson a little for his inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it like, that Johnny Bennett&mdash;a slip of a boy&mdash;can
      do for ye with Simeon Tetlow?&rdquo; she had demanded scornfully when the
      week had gone by and no word had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a way ye can trust, Jennie&mdash;the boy has,&rdquo; the old
      man had replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best trust yourself,&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and stan&rsquo; up before Sim Tetlow. Tell him to his face what
      ye want. And if he won&rsquo;t give it to ye&mdash;then <i>curse him!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the old man wavered forth, half driven to a task to which he felt
      himself unequal. But his reliance was on the boy. He would find him and
      ask what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Bennett?&rdquo; The assistant bookkeeper, hurrying back from
      luncheon a little late, paused in the doorway, looking at the tall,
      red-eyed Scotchman who put the anxious question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Bennett?&rdquo; He wrinkled his brow a little, as if trying to
      place so unimportant a person&mdash;&ldquo;I think he works up above&mdash;top
      floor. Take the elevator.&rdquo; He passed on, chuckling a little at the
      invasion of the sacred territory. &ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody comes up here,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      he said mincingly, as he drew the ledger toward him and plunged into work,
      harrying to make ap lost time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson looked a little fearfully at the iron cage, plying up and down.
      He cast an eye about for the more friendly stairway. He was not afraid of
      any engine, however mighty and plunging, that held to solid earth, keeping
      its track with open sky; but these prisoned forces and office slaves,
      clacking back and forth in their narrow walls, and elevators knocking at a
      man&rsquo;s stomach, were less to his mind. He climbed laboriously up the
      long stairs, flight after flight, his spent breath gasping at each turn.
      At the top floor he gazed around him, his mouth a little open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A queer place for the lad,&rdquo; he said to himself, his faith in
      John oozing a little as he walked across and knocked at the door of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence; then the scraping legs of a chair, and
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson had raised his hand ready to rap again. The door receded before
      his knuckles....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the president of the road, himself, Simeon Tetlow&mdash;whom all
      men hated and feared&mdash;standing there grim and terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson&rsquo;s nerveless hand rose to his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wanting to ask you something, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man surveyed him with a scowl. &ldquo;Who told you to come up here?&rdquo;
      he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were Johnny Bennett, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The scowling face changed subtly. It seemed to grow more human beneath its
      mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson took heart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a word I want with you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson shut the door circumspectly and stood turning his hat in his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s the place, sir&mdash;I &rsquo;m Tomlinson,&rdquo; he
      said.&ldquo;<i>Oh&mdash;you&mdash;are&mdash;Tomlinson</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man shrank a little, as if each word had struck him lightly in the
      face. Then he raised his head. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve served the road forty
      year,&rdquo; he said, repeating his lesson, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve never
      done harm. I&rsquo;ve worked early and I&rsquo;ve worked late for ye, and
      never a word of complaint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the road stirred sharply. &ldquo;The Bridgewater wreck&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man raised his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that I wanted to speak
      about, Mr. Tetlow.&rdquo; There was a simple dignity in the words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      been on duty seventeen hour&mdash;and ten hour before that&mdash;with not
      a wink of sleep. They run us hard on the hours, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other men stand it&mdash;the young men.&rdquo; The words had a
      kind of cutting emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man raised his red eyes. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve not gi&rsquo;ed
      their strength to the road, sir, as I have&mdash;&rdquo; He threw out a
      hand. &ldquo;The road&rsquo;s had all o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon eyed him keenly, the bent look and worn shoulders. His glance
      traveled up and down the thin frame slowly.... Not an ounce of work left
      in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;ve no place for incompetents,&rdquo; he said, turning
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson made a step forward, as if he would touch him with his hands.
      Then he stood quiet. &ldquo;There might be a boy&rsquo;s place, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man wheeled sharply, driven without and within&mdash;&ldquo;I tell you
      we&rsquo;ve nothing for you. You &rsquo;ve done your work. You &rsquo;ve
      had your pay. You &rsquo;re used up.&rdquo; It was the biting truth and
      the old man shrank before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spend any more time on you,&rdquo; said the president
      of the road. He turned decisively to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Tomlinson stood with bent head. Then he raised his red-rimmed
      eyes, fixing them on the man before him. His right hand lifted itself
      significantly. &ldquo;May the God in heaven curse ye, Simeon Tetlow, as ye
      have cursed me this day. May He shrivel ye, body and soul, in hell&mdash;&rdquo;
      The words were shrill. &ldquo;Curse ye&mdash;curse ye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a step nearer, his eyes still on the other&rsquo;s face....
      Gradually a change seemed to come over him. The bent figure straightened
      itself. It towered above the president of the road, filling the little
      room. The chieftain of some mighty Highland clan might have stood thus,
      defying his enemy. His lifted right hand grew tense and flung itself, and
      a torrent of broad Scotch poured forth. Words of fire, heard in Tomlinson&rsquo;s
      boyhood and forgotten long since, were on his tongue. The elemental
      passions were afire within him. Like the slow-burning peat of his native
      bogs, his soul, nourishing its spark through the years, had blazed forth&mdash;a
      scorching torrent. The words rolled on, a mighty flood, enveloping the man
      before him. Scathing tongues of flame darted at him and drew back, and
      leaped high&mdash;to fall in fiery, stinging showers on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first words of the imprecation the president of the road had lifted
      his head with a little smile&mdash;almost of scorn&mdash;on his lips, as
      one might watch some domestic animal reverting to its ancestral rage. But
      as the broad Scotch rolled on&mdash;stem, implacable and sinister&mdash;the
      smile faded a little and the man seemed to shrivel where he stood, as if
      some fiery blast touched him. When he raised his head again, the look in
      his eyes was of cold steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a minute after the voice had ceased, then he lifted his hand
      quietly. &ldquo;You &rsquo;ve had your say, Tomlinson. Now I &rsquo;ll say
      mine&mdash;You leave this office and you leave the road. You &rsquo;ll
      never touch brake or throttle or switch on it again. You &rsquo;re not fit&mdash;do
      you understand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved his hand toward the door and Tomlinson went out, a tottering old
      man once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long minute the president of the road stood staring at the closed
      door. The hand that had pointed to it had not trembled; but now it began
      subtly, as if of its own will, to move. Slowly the vibration communicated
      itself to the whole frame till the man threw himself into a chair, broken
      from head to foot. He leaned toward his desk, gasping a little. &ldquo;My
      God!&rdquo; he said under his breath, &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; He lifted his
      hand and wiped the moisture from his forehead with the dazed look of one
      who has come through some mighty upheaval unharmed.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nother week went
      by before John was free to go back. The day before his return he received
      a letter, addressed in a huge, sprawling hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      I seen him. I cursed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Tomlinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon made no reference to the visit or the curse, and John waited,
      wondering a little whether it might be possible, even now, to undo the
      consequences of the old man&rsquo;s folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there was any connection between Simeon&rsquo;s growing weakness and
      the old Scotchman&rsquo;s visit did not occur to him. There were
      difficulties enough in the office to account for it without going outside.
      As the days went by and he watched the worn face, he grew more anxious. A
      look haunted the eyes&mdash;something almost crafty&mdash;they gazed at
      the simplest thing as if unseen terror lurked in it; and he started at any
      sudden noise as one pursued.... When John, leaning across the desk, pushed
      a book to the floor, he leaped to his feet, his hand upraised to strike,
      his lip drawn back from his teeth in quick rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night John made a midnight journey, traveling all night and coming
      back at dawn. He had been to consult Dr. Blake, the great specialist,
      laying the case before him&mdash;withholding only the name of the man
      whose health was in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician had listened, his head a little bent, his eyes looking out
      as if seeing the man whom John described. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same story&mdash;I
      hear it every day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I call it Ameri-canitis&mdash;It
      does n&rsquo;t make much difference what you call it.... He must stop work&mdash;at
      once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said John as promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician looked at him keenly. &ldquo;I suppose not&mdash;one of the
      symptoms. You have influence with him&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John shook his head slowly. &ldquo;Not enough for that. I might get him to
      do other things, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would take medicine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; He waited a little. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m afraid he
      &rsquo;s losing his mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really what
      I want to know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t dare let him go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician assented. &ldquo;If I could see him ten minutes, I could
      tell, perhaps&mdash;more. But not in the dark, like this. You ask too
      much,&rdquo; he said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      John gave a quick sigh. &ldquo;He will never come to you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician had drawn a paper toward him and was writing on it. &ldquo;I
      can give certain general directions. If they don&rsquo;t help, he <i>must</i>
      come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited while the pen scratched on. &ldquo;These baths,&rdquo; said
      the physician, &ldquo;are good. They may help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes grew dubious&mdash;a little wide with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These other things,&rdquo; went on the physician, &ldquo;are for
      your discretion. He &rsquo;s probably under-nourished. Raw eggs will give
      him what he needs&mdash;tax him least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you can get into him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s eyes grew larger&mdash;at the way before him....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does n&rsquo;t half breathe, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch him. Take him in hand. He must breathe deep&mdash;all the
      time, night and day. Here, I will show you.&rdquo; He put his hand on the
      young man&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Go on&mdash;I &rsquo;ll tell you when to
      stop&mdash;&rdquo; He held the hand in place a few minutes, then he
      withdrew it with a smile. &ldquo;Tell him to breathe like that,&rdquo; he
      said quietly. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll get well then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t everybody breathe that way?&rdquo; asked the youth
      helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician laughed out. &ldquo;If they did, they would n&rsquo;t be
      nervous wrecks.&rdquo; He handed him the list of instructions. &ldquo;He
      must be spared any nervous worry, of course. That is the most important of
      all. Good-by. If he gets unmanageable, send him to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; said John with a little smile that was half
      a frown. He was not appalled at the details of nursing thrust upon him. He
      had cared for his mother too long and skilfully to be worried by these.
      But Simeon&mdash;yielding gracefully to being dieted&mdash;told what to
      eat and how to breathe and little things like that&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the home journey he devoted himself to planning ambushes for Simeon&rsquo;s
      obstinacy; and when, after a vigorous bath, he arrived at the office, he
      was equipped with a dozen &ldquo;strictly fresh&rdquo; eggs in a paper
      bag; a small egg-beater in one pocket and a flask of brandy in the other.
      This last was a little addition of John&rsquo;s own&mdash;prompted by
      wisdom, and a knowledge of Simeon. He put the eggs carefully on a high
      shelf. It would not do to rouse untimely prejudice against them by
      untoward accidents. The egg-beater and brandy he concealed skilfully
      behind a row of ledgers. When Simeon entered a little later, irritable and
      suspicious, there was no sign that the office was to be turned into a kind
      of fresh air hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows were open and a little breeze came in. John, refreshed by his
      bath, was hard at work, the broad, phlegmatic back a kind of huge mountain
      of strength. The little man threw himself into his chair with a grunt. He
      would rest more looking at that back than he could in a bed all night,
      tossing and turning through the hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schemes had haunted him&mdash;visions for the road&mdash;New tracks to be
      run&mdash;new regulations. Investments along the route, a little here and
      a little there, not for the corporation, but to build up the country&mdash;capital
      to help out feeble enterprises. And athwart the visions ran black shadows&mdash;disturbing
      dreams of the C., B. and L., always waiting, weapon in hand, to spring
      upon him.... If only they would fight fair! He had tossed restlessly,
      seeking a cool place for his tired head. There was no time to spend in
      fighting.&mdash;So much to be done&mdash;his whole life-work to build
      anew.... Then he had fallen again to staring at the vision as it flared
      across the night, the vision of light and wonder.... When morning came, he
      had slept perhaps an hour..
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, in the cool office, he could rest. The boy came and went with
      quiet step, his hand everywhere, yet without hurry, and his thought
      running always ahead of Simeon&rsquo;s, smoothing the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the road had intended to rest, but before he knew it, he
      was hurrying feverishly to finish a letter for the ten o&rsquo;clock mail.
      His head throbbed and his hand, as it dipped the pen in the ink, shook
      quick spatters across the paper. He swore under his breath, dabbing the
      blotter here and there.... There was a gentle shiver of egg shell, a
      little whirring sound that buzzed, and then, upon the air of the room, a
      subtle, pervasive odor. Simeon raised his head and sniffed. Then he looked
      around. The boy was at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take this, sir,&rdquo; he said casually. He set
      it down beside him, picked up a pile of papers and returned to his own
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon dropped an eye to the glass of yellow foam. He looked hastily away.
      He particularly and fervently hated an egg&mdash;and an egg that foamed&mdash;&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
      He wrote savagely, the gentle odor stealing up wooingly, appealingly to
      his nostrils. He moved restlessly in his chair, throwing back his head, as
      if to shake it off. Then his hand reached out slowly&mdash;shook a little&mdash;and
      closed upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, with his back to him, went on slowly sorting papers. When he looked
      around, the glass, with its little flecks of foam, stood empty and Simeon
      was writing fiercely. The boy took the glass to the faucet and washed it,
      humming a little, gentle tune to himself as the water ran. The first step
      in a long and difficult way had been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one knew better than John that it was only a first step and that
      the road ahead was strewn with difficulties.... It was at the seventh egg
      that Simeon rebelled openly, and John was forced to retire upon
      six-thankful to have achieved as much as this, and thankful to have
      discovered the limit. &ldquo;As many as you can get into him,&rdquo; the
      physician had said. John had not known what this number might be, until
      the day of the explosion&mdash;when the seventh egg was proffered and
      rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had swept up the fragments of glass and repaired damages with grateful
      heart.... Six a day was the limit. But there ought to be a great deal of
      nourishment in six eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there was, Simeon&rsquo;s conduct proved. He rose to a kind of new,
      fierce strength that exhausted itself each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;s just eggs!&rdquo; thought the youth, watching him
      gloomily. &ldquo;He has n&rsquo;t gained an inch. It all goes into work.&rdquo;
      And he set himself anew to spare the nervous, driven frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when he hoped, for a little, that a permanent gain had
      been made. But an emergency would arise and three days would be used up in
      one blaze of wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The C., B. and L. was tireless in its attacks, goading him on, nagging him&mdash;now
      here, now there&mdash;till he shook his nervous fists, palpitating, in
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve held back those machines on purpose,&rdquo; he said,
      one morning, late in September.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those machines&rdquo; were a consignment of harvesters, sidetracked
      somewhere along the C., B. and L. and not to be located. The &ldquo;B. and
      Q.&rdquo; had been telegraphing frantically for weeks&mdash;only to
      receive cool and regretful apologies. Farmers were besieging the road. A
      whole crop depended on the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon tossed the last telegram to John with a grunt. &ldquo;We &rsquo;ll
      have to give it up,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late. But
      they shall pay for it&mdash;if there is a law in the land, they shall make
      it good&mdash;every cent. Think of that crop&mdash;wasted for deviltry!&rdquo;
      He groaned suddenly and the hand resting on the desk trembled heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could n&rsquo;t have helped it, sir,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;They
      would have done it, anyway, and you&rsquo;ve made them trouble enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He turned his
      head restlessly, as if pursued. &ldquo;I think any other man would have
      made &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed out. &ldquo;They &rsquo;re afraid of you, sir&mdash;for
      their life! You &rsquo;ve <i>made</i> the &rsquo;R. and Q.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gulped a little. He glanced suspiciously at the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      ruined it, I think,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;<i>There &rsquo;s a
      curse on everything I touch!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Look at <i>me!</i>&rdquo; The young man threw back his
      head, choosing the first words at hand to banish the look in Simeon&rsquo;s
      face. It was this look&mdash;the shadow haunting the eyes, that troubled
      him. Sometimes when he turned and caught it, his own heart seemed suddenly
      to stop its beat, at what it saw there. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he said
      laughing. &ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t ruined <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at him&mdash;a long, slow, hopeless look. Then he shook his
      head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, John. I&rsquo;m broken&mdash;! The road
      has used all of me&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly, his gaze fixed on
      the floor.... A memory rang in his ear. The high Scotch voice thrilled
      through it. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve not gi&rsquo;e their strength to the
      road, as I have. The road&rsquo;s had all o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night John visited Dr. Blake again.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he assistant
      bookkeeper had returned from his two weeks&rsquo; vacation&mdash;most of
      which had been spent in the vicinity of the main offices of the C., B. and
      L.&mdash;feeling a little sore. He had not been treated with the respect
      due to a person entrusted with important interests. Certain reports which
      represented hours of faithful work had been looked upon as of little
      worth, and others&mdash;facts most difficult, even dangerous, to obtain&mdash;had
      been demanded crassly. Moreover, his statement that the president of the
      &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; was practically a broken-down man had been openly
      flouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; the manager of the C., B. and L.
      had declared, sitting back in his big chair. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a
      broken-down man for years. I&rsquo;d like to be broken-down, myself, the
      way he is, a little while!&rdquo; Eds chair creaked comfortably. &ldquo;He
      &rsquo;s a steel trap! That &rsquo;s what he is!&rdquo; he said sharply.
      &ldquo;Look out for your fingers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant bookkeeper had smiled ruefully, rubbing the fingers
      together. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ve never seen him before,&rdquo; he
      said respectfully, &ldquo;but if I know a man that &rsquo;s pretty near
      frazzled out&mdash;he &rsquo;s the man. There&rsquo;s nothing to him but a
      blaze.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; said the manager brusquely. He
      took a sealed envelope from the desk and held it out.... &ldquo;When you
      report again, we want the names of all parties shipping, with rates&mdash;and
      rebates,&rdquo; he added significantly. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, you
      know.&rdquo; He tapped the report that had cost the assistant bookkeeper
      many anxious hours&mdash;lightly with his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper, whose hand almost of itself had reached out for the
      envelope, hesitated a little. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I shall stay
      with the &rsquo;R. and Q.,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; The manager&rsquo;s keen eyes read his
      little soul through&mdash;and smiled. &ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t any
      particular position in mind where you can draw a better salary for keeping
      one set of books, have you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have&mdash;just now.&rdquo; The tone was
      defiant&mdash;but wobbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, stay where you are. You won&rsquo;t do better. Take my
      advice. You &rsquo;re getting along all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant bookkeeper glanced again at the envelope&mdash;and took it.
      &ldquo;You better see Tetlow, yourself,&rdquo; he said as he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager nodded. &ldquo;You &rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrington will bear watching,&rdquo; he said to the division
      superintendent. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust anybody,&rdquo; said the superintendent. &ldquo;You
      won&rsquo;t get fooled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew the truth about Sim Tetlow,&rdquo; went on the other.
      &ldquo;It would be just like him to pretend he was a wreck, and then
      spring on us and paw us all over while we &rsquo;re getting ready to
      squeeze him.... You can&rsquo;t trust Harrington. He works for his pay.&rdquo;
      He touched the report a little scornfully. &ldquo;But who knows that
      Tetlow is n&rsquo;t paying him&mdash;to say that he &rsquo;s a wreck&mdash;That
      makes three salaries&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see for yourself,&rdquo; said the other curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager&rsquo;s face grew thoughtful. The shrewd light spread to his
      fat cheeks. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s a good idea. I &rsquo;ll do it&mdash;right
      off.&rdquo;

      second visit to Dr. Blake was much briefer than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had refused to advise further without direct consultation.
      &ldquo;I must see the man,&rdquo; he said decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when John had demurred, he had asked the patient&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simeon Tetlow!&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, but smiling a little.
      &ldquo;Why did n&rsquo;t you tell me at first it was Sim Tetlow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him years ago, in college. He was n&rsquo;t what he is now&mdash;more
      human blood. I knew him pretty well up to the time he was married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked up. &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know he was married!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful woman,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;too good for him&mdash;She
      died the next year&mdash;and the baby&mdash;That was twenty years ago and
      more........ So it&rsquo;s Sim! I might have guessed. There is n&rsquo;t a
      man in a thousand miles that fits the case as he does&mdash;Driving
      himself to death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man waited directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him to me,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll come&mdash;Yes.
      He won&rsquo;t mind seeing <i>me!</i>&rdquo; He laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      John started for home with lighter heart. Simeon would obey the great
      doctor&mdash;and all would be well. He even slept a little on the way. But
      when the train reached Bay-port, it was not yet three o&rsquo;clock. He
      hesitated as he left the station. He had not expected to reach home before
      morning and his mother was not expecting him. She would be sure to waken&mdash;perhaps
      lie awake the rest of the night. He turned his steps toward the &ldquo;R.
      and Q.&rdquo; office building. There was a cushioned settle in the little
      upper office; he had had it brought in lately&mdash;in the hope that
      Simeon would use it. He would spend the rest of the night there, and be on
      hand in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the key noiselessly in the lock and went in. The great building
      lay silent and shadowy as he made his way from room to room, up flight
      after flight of long stairs, guided only by the sense of touch and
      familiarity. The darkness about him seemed filled with whispers&mdash;plots,
      counterplots. He felt them vaguely, as he climbed&mdash;yet with a certain
      serenity of heart. Simeon would see Dr. Blake. All would be right. Let the
      master of the road once be master of himself and the shadows would melt.
      He crossed the upper loft and went into the little room. The air was
      stifling, after the freshness outside, and he threw open the windows,
      leaning out to breathe deep. He heard the roar of the engine coming into
      the yard on the still air and saw the lights gleam through the smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful night. The deep September sky twinkled with stars and
      far below him, the city, dark and mysterious and sad, lifted its
      glimmering lamps. They broke the darkness, luminous, faint&mdash;like some
      inner meaning. The youth looking down had a sudden, quickened sense of
      power, vast issues, mighty interests. The city slept at his feet,
      beautiful, relaxed. Fold upon fold of darkness wrapped it round and his
      heart went out to it&mdash;helpless there in the darkness&mdash;and in its
      midst, Simeon&mdash;asleep or awake&mdash;waiting the new day. A fresh
      loyalty to the man swelled within him. The sleeping city touched him in a
      way he could not name&mdash;its mighty power cradled in the night in
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself on the couch and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the lightest click... but he sat up, his eyes fixed on darkness.
      The lock clicked again and the door swung open. He felt it move softly
      through the black, and close again. A footstep crossed the floor. John
      waited. He was leaning forward, staring before him, his slow mind
      wrestling with the sounds that came and went, lightly. He was unarmed. He
      had only his hands; he clinched them a little and felt the muscles swell
      behind them. He was not altogether defenceless!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds puzzled him. They were methodical, deliberate&mdash;not as if
      finding out the way, but as if accustomed to the place and to darkness.
      ... Simeon Tetlow, himself?&mdash;The thought flashed at him and drew
      back. ... A light stole through the gloom&mdash;the focused glow of the
      electric pocket candle on a desk across the room&mdash;Simeon&rsquo;s
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      John leaned forward, holding his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Behind the candle, a vague form&mdash;a massive head and shoulders,
      bending above the lock of the desk.... The key was fitted in and the top
      lifted. Then, for the first time, the man seemed to hesitate, his head
      turning itself a little in the shadow and waiting, as if disturbed. The
      glow of the candle suddenly went out and the steps moved stealthily. John
      straightened himself&mdash;the clinched hand ready.... The steps receded
      slowly and a hand fumbled at the open window, lowering it without sound
      and drawing down the thick shade. The man moved to the other window and
      closed it. The youth on the lounge caught the muttered sound of his own
      name, as if in imprecation.... Then the steps again. ... And suddenly the
      soft candle&mdash;shining in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man reached into the half-gloom of the desk for a ledger. He seemed to
      know without hesitation which he wanted. He opened it and fell to work,
      apparently in the middle of a page, the sinister eye of the candle
      traveling up and down the columns, the scratching pen transcribing figures
      to a kind of muttered accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      John recognized the book, in the shadowy light.... He ought not to have
      left it there. He had more than half guessed this thing before.... So this
      was the reason why Hemenway &amp; Hill countermanded their order for fifty
      cars, a week ago, and Gardner &amp; Hutchinson changed their mind about
      shipping their wheat the thirtieth... and this thing had been going on for
      weeks?&mdash;months?... No, it was only within six weeks that the book had
      been tampered with.... His mind ran back over the time, fitting each
      coincidence in place.... So this was it! It was state prison for the
      man.... But suppose he were not arrested?... Suppose he were let to go
      free&mdash;in fear of his life.... John, watching, gauged the man, sitting
      there in the night, his busy pen writing his own doom.... He should go on
      sending the reports. The enemy should have their bulletin from day to day,
      but it should be compiled by John Bennett. The scribe should have only the
      work of copying.... It might save time if the arrangement were completed
      now. He moved his hand a trifle toward the wall behind him, groping a
      little. The next minute the room was a blaze of light and the man at the
      desk was on his feet, stifling a quick cry&mdash;blinking at the looping
      bulbs of light. He made a swift step toward the door; but some one,
      broad-shouldered and smiling, stood against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Harrington,&rdquo; said John quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s hands swung out blindly. Then they fell to his sides. He
      was panting a little, as if he had come a long distance. But his eyes were
      fixed on John&rsquo;s face with a little sneer. &ldquo;Think you &rsquo;re
      clever, don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; he said doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;though it does n&rsquo;t
      seem to have done you much good,&rdquo; he added after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s fingers were fumbling at the desk, striving to gather up
      and destroy the papers jotted with figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let those alone!&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fingers ceased their work, but they still moved restlessly, playing on
      the air. The sudden fright had done its work.... Quietly, bit by bit, John
      laid the plan before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you I don&rsquo;t <i>dare</i> do it,&rdquo; said the
      man. His voice was a kind of shrill moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare <i>not</i> to?&rdquo; asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; It was crafty, with a sullen note just below the
      surface. &ldquo;You give me the figures and I &rsquo;ll copy &rsquo;em and
      send &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> will send them,&rdquo; said John slowly, &ldquo;and so
      long as you play fair, no one else knows it. But if you betray us by one
      breath&mdash;I give the matter over to President Tetlow&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had started. &ldquo;No,&mdash;You won&rsquo;t do that&mdash;No!&rdquo;
      He was almost cowering before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled a little, looking down at him. So it was still a name to
      conjure with! His mind wandered inconsequently to the bag of eggs on the
      high shelf and the egg-beater hanging on its nail behind the cupboard
      door. The man little knew that they were President Tetlow. He was still a
      terror to evil doers. &ldquo;One breath&mdash;and I tell him!&rdquo; said
      John sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shrank a little. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said. He,
      himself, could not have accounted for the fear that held him. He knew that
      the president of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; road was a broken man; he had
      sworn it to the manager of the C. B. and L.; but none the less he was
      afraid. A phrase that he had heard long since, stirred in his mind&mdash;&ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t cross Sim Tetlow and live!&rdquo; He wanted to live&mdash;the
      assistant bookkeeper&mdash;he desired earnestly to live&mdash;and to
      prosper. He had done his best for years&mdash;Yet it seemed always to
      evade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll do it all right for you&mdash;I &rsquo;ll act on the
      square,&rdquo; he said magnanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;You &rsquo;ll do what you have to,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden hatred of this young man flared in the assistant bookkeeper&rsquo;s
      heart. Then he remembered the look in Nixon&rsquo;s face&mdash;manager of
      the C. B. and L.&mdash;the day he had seen him last. It struck him that
      the two looks were curiously alike. &ldquo;I hate Nixon!&rdquo; he said
      viciously, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll be glad to get one on him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does n&rsquo;t he pay you well?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man writhed a little. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my affair,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Keep it your affair,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll
      pay you&mdash;same as ever&mdash;and you &rsquo;re to take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at him. His jaw had dropped a little. He moved toward the
      door. &ldquo;You &rsquo;re a deep un. I don&rsquo;t want anything to do
      with you.... I can&rsquo;t face Nixon&mdash;every month, I tell you. He&rsquo;d
      kill me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You face him&mdash;or Simeon Tetlow,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;You
      take your choice.&rdquo; He moved back from the door and the man stepped
      toward it. He opened it quickly and went out. The sound of his footsteps,
      hurrying as if pursued, died away in the outer loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at the disordered
      desk. Then he gathered up the papers and returned the ledger to its place.
      He locked the desk and turned off the blaze of light before he opened the
      windows. He stood looking down at the city in the mysterious night. Then
      he threw himself on the couch and slept till the morning.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IMEON was tearing
      open his morning&rsquo;s mail, fussing and growling. &ldquo;There &rsquo;s
      another&mdash;&rdquo; He tossed it to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man read it without comment. It was from the farmers of Elk Horn
      County&mdash;the second within a month&mdash;accusing the road of keeping
      back cars to force up rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had their share,&rdquo; grumbled Simeon from his
      mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More, too,&rdquo; said John. He scowled his brow a little. &ldquo;No.
      8 brought in thirty-five empties yesterday,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon wheeled a little, &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somers&mdash;most of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Somers shall have &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Simeon. He wheeled
      back again. &ldquo;Let the Elk Horners run a road of their own. They know
      so much. Let their press agent get at it&mdash;Make cars out o&rsquo; wind
      and haul &rsquo;em with talk.&rdquo; He plunged again into the mail,
      tearing and gritting his way through. Suddenly there was silence in the
      room&mdash;A long hush&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the road was huddled a little forward, his eyes on a
      letter that his shaking hands tried in vain to steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stepped quickly to his side. But the man did not look up. His eyes
      seemed glued to the few lines that covered the page. When the shaking hand
      dropped to the desk, he sat staring at nothing where the lines had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      John went out noiselessly and mixed an egg and placed it beside him. He
      knew from the look in Simeon&rsquo;s face that he had not slept, and he
      guessed that he had had no breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;d better take this, sir,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon&rsquo;s hand groped a little toward it and drew back. &ldquo;I tell
      you I can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nixon&mdash;&rdquo; He touched the paper beside him. &ldquo;He
      wants to talk over rates. I tell you I can&rsquo;t see him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
      It was almost a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took up the letter. &ldquo;Perhaps you won&rsquo;t need to,
      sir.&rdquo; His slow eyes were on the words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the
      rates,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe it?&rdquo; The president of the road leaned toward
      him a little, hissing the words at him. &ldquo;He says what he wants is an
      appointment for seeing <i>me!</i>&rdquo; He lifted the haggard face, the
      bitter laugh drawing back the thin lips from his teeth. &ldquo;What do you
      think our stock &rsquo;d be worth the next day? I tell you it &rsquo;s a
      trap!&rdquo; He lifted his shaking hand. He looked at the light through
      it. &ldquo;He wants to see <i>me!</i>&rdquo; he repeated bitterly. &ldquo;Let
      him come,&rdquo; he said shrilly; &ldquo;let him&mdash;&rdquo; The hand
      dropped to the desk. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve lost my nerve, John!&rdquo; he
      whispered helplessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my nerve!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better take your egg, sir,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon reached out blindly and gulped it down. His hand quivered as he
      wiped the little yellow line from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes were on his face&mdash;&ldquo;Had you thought of seeing
      Dr. Blake?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand paused in mid air. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;thought&mdash;of
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man picked up the letter. &ldquo;Wednesday &rsquo;s Nixon&rsquo;s
      day, is n&rsquo;t it? Why not see Dr. Blake Wednesday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man leaned forward. &ldquo;What about Nixon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll see Nixon, sir,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon stared at him a minute&mdash;&ldquo;What would you say to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon stared again. Then he chuckled a little. &ldquo;I believe you
      could,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;He &rsquo;d go away thinking I was a
      prizefighter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s hand rested lightly on the shaking one, holding it firm, and
      his eyes were on the quivering, driven face. &ldquo;He &rsquo;d go away
      thinking the truth, sir&mdash;that you are a big man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon smiled a little shame-facedly, drawing away the hand. &ldquo;I
      &rsquo;m a big fool,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;There is n&rsquo;t a
      bigger anywhere&mdash;except you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s face expressed content. &ldquo;You will see Dr.
      Blake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll see Blake&mdash;yes.&rdquo; The shadow had returned
      again to his face, blotting out hope. He had drawn a sheet of paper toward
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll see Blake if you want me to. But Blake can&rsquo;t help&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blake can, if anybody can,&rdquo; said John stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anybody can&mdash;yes.&rdquo; It was a half whisper. He was
      writing wearily, like an old man. Presently the pen stopped and he sat
      staring before him.... A little look of hope stole into the set face. He
      took up his cheque-book and filled in a cheque in his fine, scrawling
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around. The young man was hard at work. He waited a minute,
      impatient. Then he spoke, hesitating a little between the words, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;John&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He came across.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might like to make a present&mdash;to your friend
      Tomlinson?&rdquo; He was holding out the slip of paper indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked down. It was a cheque for a thousand dollars. His face
      lighted with a quick smile. &ldquo;It looks as if <i>you</i> were the
      friend,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomlinson &rsquo;s no friend of mine,&rdquo; said Simeon gruffly.
      &ldquo;But you can send it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall go today, sir.&rdquo; He was moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon&rsquo;s hand reached out to him. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s to come from
      you, you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man paused. He shook his head slowly. &ldquo;He knows we have n&rsquo;t
      a cent in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it from the directors then&mdash;for services rendered.&rdquo;
      He laughed&mdash;a little bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;from the directors&mdash;for services rendered.&rdquo;
      John wrote the letter and sent it. But he knew that the cheque that went
      with it was not recorded on the books of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; Road.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he manager of the
      C. B. and L. was being shown into the president&rsquo;s office&mdash;not
      the little room on the upper floor, but the one with the bronze token on
      the door. The typewriters had been driven out for the day on some pretext
      of cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the manager entered the office, he saw a young man seated at the desk,
      his round head and broad back absorbed in work. His impatient eye swept
      the room&mdash;no one else!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;ah&mdash;I wish to see President Tetlow,&rdquo; he said
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man at the desk rose and turned slowly, facing him. The manager
      was conscious of a pair of clear, straight eyes looking into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked down below for Tetlow,&rdquo; he said a little less
      brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mr. Nixon?&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manager of the C. B. and L.,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow smile on John&rsquo;s face made him welcome. &ldquo;President
      Tetlow asked me to see you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; There was a flash of suspicion in the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was called out of town. An old friend wrote, asking to see him
      today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t know Sim Tetlow had any friends&mdash;any old ones,&rdquo;
      said the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit down, sir?&rdquo; said John. He drew forward one of
      the capacious chairs and the man sank into it, giving a little nip to each
      trouser leg, just above the knee, before he settled back comfortably, a
      hand resting on either arm of the big chair. He glanced about the room.
      &ldquo;Comfortable quarters,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was standing opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;President Tetlow asked me to give you any details you might wish,
      sir, and to represent him as far as I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the big chair surveyed him for a moment. &ldquo;And who might
      <i>you</i> be?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly. There was more than a bint of
      irony in the light words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am John Bennett,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m. I am glad to know. And do you hold&mdash;any particular
      position?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was looking at him steadily. A slow smile had crept into his
      eyes. &ldquo;I never thought <i>what</i> I am,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager smiled too&mdash;in spite of himself. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      think you &rsquo;ve made a mistake in assuming that Tetlow expected you to
      see me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes were quiet. &ldquo;No, sir. He said I was to give you
      all the help I can. I know about the books&mdash;orders and correspondence
      and things like that,&rdquo; he added after a minute, &ldquo;I can perhaps
      tell you what you want to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager was searching his memory.... What was it Harrington had
      reported&mdash;a new private secretary&mdash;he might make trouble? Ah,
      yes&mdash;&ldquo;You have not been here long?&rdquo; he said abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since June,&rdquo; replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said the manager, but
      with a little more respect in his voice. &ldquo;The deals I want to talk
      over go back two or three years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was with President Tetlow then,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I came
      about four years ago. During the last year I &rsquo;ve been off for a
      while.&mdash;My mother was ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother was ill?&rdquo; He whistled softly between his teeth. It
      might, after all, be good luck that Tetlow was away. This simple youth
      would reveal more in half an hour than Simeon would let out in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would win his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He settled back a little in the chair. &ldquo;Tetlow a hard man to work
      for?&rdquo; he asked casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s smile answered his, &ldquo;I guess everybody thinks so,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded. &ldquo;I guess so.&mdash;They say he &rsquo;s a good deal
      broken, though&mdash;works too hard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He works harder than any man I ever saw,&rdquo; replied John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begins to tell on him, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The man seemed to be
      watching a fly on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; John&rsquo;s face expressed slow interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean he &rsquo;s about used up,&rdquo; said the manager, flashing
      a look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      John shook his head, and the slow smile grew in his face. &ldquo;You <i>think</i>
      he &rsquo;s used up and then you find&mdash;he is n&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s
      the kind of man President Tetlow is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager gave a dry smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that &rsquo;s the
      kind he is, myself.&rdquo; He turned suddenly, his eyes boring into the
      young man. &ldquo;What &rsquo;s all this bother about rates this year!&rdquo;
      he asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he know the roads can&rsquo;t stand it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks the country can&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country!&rdquo; The man stared at him, moistening his lips a
      little with his tongue. He shook his head. &ldquo;Never heard of the
      country before,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled. &ldquo;President Tetlow wants to make the &lsquo;R. and Q.&rsquo;
      a benefit to the region.&rdquo; The man sat back in his chair. He spread
      his legs a little. Then he opened his mouth. He laughed. There was
      affectation in the laugh, perhaps, but beneath it was solid amusement and
      scorn. &ldquo;Sim Tetlow&mdash;philanthropist!&rdquo; He shook his head,&mdash;&ldquo;Look
      out for him!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he don&rsquo;t mean it, sir!&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; said the big man.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s clear eyes looked into the small, fat ones and the man
      stirred a little in his chair and sat up. &ldquo;Do you believe it?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;He does n&rsquo;t start out on
      things he can&rsquo;t carry through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;s right,&rdquo; muttered the man. His face was
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always run the road before for the corporation. He&rsquo;s
      running it now for everybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it &rsquo;s beyond me.&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t make money
      for everybody.&rdquo; He seemed to be digesting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man had taken up some papers from the desk. &ldquo;President
      Tetlow wanted me to ask you about these,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they!&rdquo; The man swung his eyeglasses to his nose and
      held out his hand. &ldquo;They are affidavits.... about those
      harvesters....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The manager sank back a little. He took off the glasses,
      tapping the table with them. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted me to ask what you are going to do about it,&rdquo; said
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he expect we &rsquo;ll do?&rdquo; it was smooth and
      non-committal.
    </p>
    <p>
      John consulted the paper. &ldquo;He expects you &rsquo;ll pay for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little look crossed the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Oh, no. I guess not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me to say that otherwise he will take action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s face fell a little. &ldquo;Take it into court&mdash;He can&rsquo;t
      win.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &rsquo;ve just won against the Lake Shore&mdash;those planting
      machines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Indiana,&rdquo; said the man quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was Indiana. But McKinnon has three or four other similar
      cases, scattered about. He says they &rsquo;ve all won.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Buxton it was a fool thing to do!&rdquo; muttered the man
      half under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;s what President Tetlow said,&rdquo; remarked John
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m&mdash;Did he? What else did he say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled a little. &ldquo;He said if you were going to try to do him,
      it was safer to do him inside the law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m&mdash;How much is he going to stick us for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve thousand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said the man. He sat up very straight and
      folded his fingers across his stomach, guarding his rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it would be worth that&mdash;The whole district has
      suffered. The crop &rsquo;s a dead loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he let them fight for themselves?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he thinks he &rsquo;s more used to it than they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the C. B. and L. looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Tell him we
      &rsquo;ll settle for ten thousand&mdash;and not a cent more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John made a note. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll tell him, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was not in good humor. The calm eyes of the young man, and a
      certain sense of moral inferiority that came upon him, made him restless;
      and the obvious respect that this young man felt for the President of the
      &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; was not encouraging. But it occurred to the
      manager suddenly that every man has his price and he drew a little breath
      of relief, relaxing in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, when he took up his hat to go, he could not, for the
      life of him, have told whether the young man, holding open the door for
      him, was too stupid or too virtuous to take advantage of a very good offer
      that had been dangled before him. But he had a distinct impression that he
      should like to overhear some young man in his employ speak of him as this
      young man was speaking of Simeon Tetlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went through the outer room, the manager of the C. B. and L. passed
      very close to a desk where a bookkeeper was busy with columns of figures.
      But the manager did not glance that way and the bookkeeper did not lift
      his busy eyes from the page before him.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he typewriters had
      been reinstalled in the president&rsquo;s office and John, in the little
      upper room, was giving the president of the road a detailed account of the
      preceding day&mdash;including the visit from the manager of the C. B. and
      L.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Simeon. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good&mdash;as
      far as it goes.&rdquo; But his thin face still wore an anxious look and he
      sat slouched a little forward, his eyes on the floor. The morning&rsquo;s
      mail lay on the desk behind him, untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eyes turned to it. &ldquo;You saw Dr. Blake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon stirred uneasily. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He drew a quick sigh and
      turned toward the desk. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I saw him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the mail, but he did not touch it. His hand seemed to have
      lost volition and when John spoke again he gave no sign that he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stepped to him quickly and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked down at it vacantly. Then he lifted his hand and touched
      the spot where the hand had rested. He looked up, a thin, anxious smile
      quivering his face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to think&mdash;&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re tired out,&rdquo; said John promptly. &ldquo;Did you
      have any breakfast?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had&mdash;I think I had it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran his hand across his forehead. Then he looked at John. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      seem to think,&rdquo; he said helplessly. &ldquo;I think I &rsquo;m
      sleepy.... I&rsquo;m so sleepy....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man helped him to the couch and stood looking down at him. The
      eyelids had fallen and he seemed in a light slumber; his face still wore
      its seamed and exhausted look, but the anxiety had left it He breathed
      lightly like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute John turned away and gave himself to the work of the
      office. No one came to break the quiet, and the figure on the couch did
      not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon he sat up and rubbed his eyes, looking confusedly
      about the office. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep!&rdquo; he said in a tone
      of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you rested, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First rate.&rdquo; He shook himself a little and got up from the
      couch. &ldquo;Mail come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He handed him the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve answered these.&rdquo; He handed him another pile ready
      for signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon read them through with untroubled face, and signed those that were
      ready. He seemed more like himself than John had seen him for weeks; but
      the young man, watching him anxiously, was afraid to question him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the letters were finished, Simeon turned to him with a smile. &ldquo;Blake&rsquo;s
      an old granny!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man made no reply. His steady eyes were on the thin face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon nodded re-assuringly. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m all right.&mdash;You
      &rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought, to hear him talk, the funeral was
      to-morrow.&rdquo; He gave a short laugh. &ldquo;I guess he hypnotized me
      for a spell. I knew I&rsquo;d be all right as soon as I got back to you.&rdquo;
      He smiled at the youth affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon reflected. &ldquo;Said I must stop&mdash;right off&mdash;Be an
      idiot if I did n&rsquo;t.&mdash;Idiot if I did!&rdquo; he muttered
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>could</i> stop&mdash;for a while?&rdquo; It was the merest
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man turned fiercely&mdash;the old trembling awake in him. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know! You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> know!&rdquo; He threw the words
      from him. &ldquo;You &rsquo;ve staved off Nixon. But there are other
      things&mdash;worse things than Nixon&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything much worse,&rdquo; said John quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon stared at him a minute. Then he turned it aside with a motion of
      his hand. He leaned forward, speaking low and fast&mdash;&ldquo;The
      directors&mdash;two weeks off&mdash;two weeks&mdash;I <i>must</i> stay, I
      tell you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; It was the old tone of quiet deference and Simeon
      yielded to it. &ldquo;Give me two weeks,&rdquo; he said more quietly.
      &ldquo;Let me meet them with a straight record&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; The watching eyes held him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I &rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said grudgingly, &ldquo;&mdash;If
      you make me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John weighed it for a minute. &ldquo;Did you ask Dr. Blake about the two
      weeks?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon fidgeted at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It was a growl, half-defiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence in the room was unbroken. John began to arrange things for the
      night. The man at the desk watched him, resentful, suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the room was in order, the young man came across. He placed his hand
      on Simeon&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;All ready, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon started a little. He motioned to the chair. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man sat down, looking at him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon was holding a paper, fingering it absently; he had retained it when
      John put away the others, covering it with his hand. He glanced down at it
      now once or twice, as if about to speak. But when he opened his lips, it
      was not about the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blake does n&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said harshly. The young man&rsquo;s
      face clouded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust him, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon spun the paper a little contemptuously on the desk. &ldquo;I trust
      him&mdash;Yes&mdash;I trust Blake where he knows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows about you, sir.&rdquo; John, remembering the minute
      accounts he had given of Simeon&rsquo;s condition, smiled a little as he
      said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the eyes looking into his did not smile. They held a kind of dumb
      fear, and the man shook his head. &ldquo;He does n&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did n&rsquo;t you tell him sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He glanced cautiously over his shoulder
      and lowered his voice. &ldquo;He would n&rsquo;t have believed&mdash;nobody
      &rsquo;d believe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he might help, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head dully. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help. Nobody &rsquo;can
      help.&mdash;I &rsquo;ve had my chance&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off and sat
      staring before him, as if at some nameless thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man watched him with perplexed eyes. Something mysterious,
      terrible, held the man in its grip&mdash;some intangible thing. Almost, it
      seemed to him, he conld put out his hand and touch it. Then, in a breath,
      it was not there.... There was only Simeon&mdash;sitting with pitifully
      bowed head, fingering the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up after a minute. &ldquo;The Bard-well lease expires today,&rdquo;
      he said, holding up the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded. He was not thinking of the Bardwell lease. He was trying to
      follow the elusive clue that had looked out at him and withdrawn....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road takes possession tomorrow,&rdquo; said Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s mind came back to the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;d thought&mdash;&rdquo; Simeon hesitated, &ldquo;I &rsquo;d
      thought we might put some one on, for the winter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rent it?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;we can&rsquo;t rent it till spring; Nobody would want it
      now, but we could put some one on.&rdquo; He waited a minute. &ldquo;There
      &rsquo;s your friend&mdash;Tomlinson&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John leaned forward, his face alight&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;d like it, sir.
      He used to live on a farm&mdash;in Scotland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judged as much,&rdquo; said Simeon drily. &ldquo;He can have it,
      rent free, till spring. Then the road will talk about terms&mdash;we shan&rsquo;t
      be hard on him.&rdquo; He said the last words with a little gulp. He was
      looking down at the paper trembling in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will like it,&rdquo; said John heartily. &ldquo;And it will be
      good for the little Tomlinsons&mdash;There are two children, you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about them,&rdquo; said Simeon wearily.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;whether there are children&mdash;or not.
      He can have the farm, if he wants it, rent free.&rdquo; He looked about
      for his hat. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The freshness of his sleep had left him. He was old and haggard once more.
      And John, as he handed him his hat, was struck anew by the misery in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going in a minute, sir. Don&rsquo;t you want me to walk along
      with you?&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E went slowly
      toward the door&mdash;a bent old man. But at the door, he paused and
      looked back, his lip moving tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      John sprang toward him. &ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;go away&mdash;not before the fifth-two weeks.
      Blake must give me that two weeks! <i>You</i> know what it means&mdash;if
      I go now!&rdquo; His voice was harsh and he lifted his gaunt, shaking hand
      to the broad shoulder that bent toward him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ruin&mdash;John&mdash;for
      the road! I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it! It&rsquo;s my <i>life!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong hand reached up to the quivering one and drew it down, holding
      it fast. &ldquo;You shall not go, sir. You shall stay here till the fifth&mdash;and
      save the road.&rdquo; The low, quiet tone was full of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Simeon&rsquo;s voice broke across it harshly. &ldquo;Blake said he
      would n&rsquo;t give me a day&mdash;not twenty-four hours!&rdquo; he said
      hoarsely, &ldquo;You should have heard him talk!&rdquo; He shuddered a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, sir,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;You <i>shall</i> stay&mdash;if
      you want to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The helpless eyes devoured his face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He half
      whispered the words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, sir.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s face was close to his and a kind
      of power seemed to pass from the clear eyes into the wavering ones.
      &ldquo;You shall stay if you want to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I want to?&rdquo; repeated Simeon vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Listen.&rdquo; He had led him back to his chair and placed him
      in it. &ldquo;Now I will tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply, as if to a child, John laid the plan before him. It was not
      something new&mdash;thought of on the spur of the moment. For weeks the
      youth had seen the approach of some such crisis as this and his slow mind
      had been making ready for it, working out the details with careful
      exactness. If the road could be tided over the semi-annual meeting,
      everything was saved. In spite of the attacks of the C. B. and L. and in
      spite of Simeon&rsquo;s quixotic schemes for the country, there would be a
      comfortable dividend to declare. And with Simeon at the head of the table&mdash;not
      a wreck apparently, but the competent, keen-witted man whom the directors
      knew and trusted&mdash;all would be well. After that, let rumors get
      abroad&mdash;The directors would buy up any frightened stock that might be
      thrown on the market. There could be no attack on the road&mdash;with
      their confidence unshaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon&rsquo;s face, as he listened, lost its strained-look and his lips
      seemed to move to the slow words that unfolded the plan to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could do it?&rdquo; questioned John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do it,&rdquo; said Simeon with a deep breath. &ldquo;It
      &rsquo;s easy&mdash;after what I have been through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to do as I tell you&mdash;exactly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Blake,&rdquo; said Simeon, the look of fear coming
      back to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll see Blake,&rdquo; said John promptly. &ldquo;Now, you
      are going home to rest, sir. I &rsquo;ll write the letter to Tomlinson and
      then I &rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, write the letter to Tomlinson,&rdquo; said Simeon.
      &ldquo;The sooner the better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And John, as he sat down to write it, had no glimpse of the clue that was
      laughing at him, to his face, while his pen moved over the paper; he had
      no suspicion that the farm, offered rent free, was a last desperate
      attempt to lift a Scotch curse.... He saw only Tomlinson&rsquo;s face&mdash;when
      he should read the letter&mdash;and the children playing on the Bardwell
      farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician gave his consent reluctantly. &ldquo;You may be able to
      carry it through, but it&rsquo;s a great risk. He ought to stop now&mdash;at
      once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;s more quiet, sir,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;less nervous.
      He wants to sleep&mdash;falls asleep at his desk sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Blake smiled a little grimly. &ldquo;The next stage he will not be so
      quiet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Best not tempt nature too far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s face grew thoughtful. &ldquo;It would kill him to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stop now&mdash;What &rsquo;s the difference-two weeks, or now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened as John laid the facts of the case before him. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s
      rich&mdash;even if the road goes to pieces. Better lose the road than his
      reason&mdash;his life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled. &ldquo;I think the road is his reason&mdash;his life. He has
      lived in it so long that he does n&rsquo;t quite know, I think, which is
      Road and which is Simeon Tetlow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician was looking with interest at this stupid, slow-speaking
      young man, who seemed to put his finger so exactly on the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;organic, almost But there are other
      roads. He could build up another. He &rsquo;s a young man still&mdash;young
      in years. Let him recover and he will be as eager to fight as ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t quite that, sir.&rdquo; The slow mind groped for
      prosaic words in which to clothe Simeon&rsquo;s radiant dream. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      not fighting just for the love of it. He thinks the country has been
      injured&mdash;the road has made money out of it without paying back&mdash;and
      he wants to make good. If the road goes to pieces&mdash;if the C. B. and
      L. buys it up&mdash;he could never do it. I think it would kill him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician&rsquo;s head was bent in thought. &ldquo;So Sim Tetlow loves
      men&mdash;like that&mdash;as much as that!&rdquo; He looked up candidly.
      &ldquo;Do you know I should have said that there was nobody in the world
      he would turn his hand over for. And now you tell me he&rsquo;s been
      killing himself for farmers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s face flushed a little. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
      farmers, sir&mdash;nor&mdash;nor&mdash;anybody. It&rsquo;s just the <i>country!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician looked at him a minute&mdash;&ldquo;I see&mdash;it &rsquo;s
      impersonal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. But the country is like a person to him. I think he loves
      it. And I know he wants to make up for the harm he&rsquo;s done it. It
      would kill him to give up&mdash;now.... Two weeks will do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Well. You take the risk, you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The clear eyes met his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician&rsquo;s looked into them with quiet scrutiny. &ldquo;You
      &rsquo;re very fond of him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him, sir,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you should,&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow smile met his. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either. I think he
      needs me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he does,&rdquo; said the physician drily, &ldquo;more than
      he knows.&rdquo;

      XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE morning of the
      fifth of October was keen and crisp; a hint of frost lay on the grass and
      the air was filled with decks of light. It was a beautiful country that
      the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; passed through&mdash;hills and valleys, long
      stretches of wood and wide sweeps of grain, and slopes where the orchards
      crept to the sky, the trees gold and green, and burdened with fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the directors of the &ldquo;R. and Q.,&rdquo; looking out from their
      comfortable parlor cars on the trees and fields as they sped toward
      Bayport, it seemed a land of fatness and dividends. Tetlow would attend to
      all those trees. He had never failed them since the first day he laid his
      nervous, wiry hand upon the road; he had wrested the last cent from it;
      and the road&mdash;trees, barns, elevators&mdash;jingled into their
      pockets. They beamed upon the fertile land as they journeyed through,
      noting the signs of plenty with philanthropic eye.... There had been
      rumors of trouble, complaints, shortage of cars. What wonder&mdash;with
      branches loaded to the ground, or propped with staves, and the grain
      bending with its weight. They smiled at each other. They knew their man&mdash;a
      giant&mdash;keen-sighted and far-reaching&mdash;feared through the country
      up and down. When he lifted his hand, the little animals scudded to their
      holes, and lesser men made way for him. If the directors did not put the
      figure into words, they felt it&mdash;through all their comfortable being,
      as they slid along. Simeon Tetlow&mdash;great man-prosperous &ldquo;R. and
      Q.&rdquo;&mdash;fortunate directors!
    </p>
    <p>
      They felt it as they took their way to the offices of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo;
      and seated themselves in the capacious chairs about the green table.
      Tetlow was a little late&mdash;they looked inquiringly toward the door. He
      was not often late... sometimes hurried and driven, but never late.... Was
      Simeon Tetlow late! The door opened and he came in with a little flurry,
      dipping subtly to left and right, in short brusque greeting, and taking
      his seat. They settled back in their chairs, scarcely noting the short,
      square young man, a little to the left, who followed in his wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Simeon was seated, the young man remained standing and they took
      him in with careless glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes returned to Tetlow. But he motioned with a slight gesture to
      the young man and they looked at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forward with a little smile. &ldquo;President Tetlow cannot
      speak,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked with startled eyes at the president of the road. He nodded
      reassuringly and touched his throat with his hand. He opened his lips as
      if to speak, but no sound came. He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they understood. He had lost his voice&mdash;a cold, probably, or
      unusual strain upon it. They nodded their sympathy to him, as if they,
      too, were suddenly struck dumb. He smiled acknowledgment and touched his
      throat and motioned to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stood with eyes lowered, waiting while the pantomime went on; it
      was the only part that he feared. He had drilled his patient carefully.
      But his breath came a little fast.... So many things might happen. ...
      Then he looked up and met the directors&rsquo; gaze fixed upon him
      expectantly. He consulted the paper in his hand and bent to the pile that
      lay on the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;President Tetlow wishes to present first the report as a whole.&rdquo;
      He took up a handful of the papers. &ldquo;He has had duplicate copies
      made for further reference.&rdquo; He passed the handful of papers to the
      senior director at the right of the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a thrifty device&mdash;thought out in the night watches while he
      could not sleep... Simeon had never before allowed written reports. This
      was unexpected convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The senior member reached out his hand with a bland smile, swinging his
      gold eyeglasses to his nose and surveying the figures. He nodded affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood watching with slow look while the papers traveled down
      the length of the table.... It was only a guess at human nature. ... Would
      it work? Would they study the figures&mdash;or Simeon Tetlow&rsquo;s face?
      There was too much written on it for them not to see if they sat there and
      looked at it. His eyes deepened as he watched them, waiting respectfully
      on their convenience. The last paper reached the hand stretched out for it
      and he glanced swiftly up and down the double row of faces.... every eye
      buried in a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a quick breath and began to read in clear, even tone. There was no
      sense of hurry in the voice, but the words passed in swift flow. He knew
      to a minute how long it would take and how long Simeon Tetlow would keep
      the cool, inscrutable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was listening, his head a little bent, to the even flow of words. John
      did not dare to think ahead or see more than one minute at a time. For two
      weeks his one thought had been to get through this meeting.... He had
      planned, the day carefully.... It was after the periods of heavy sleep
      that Simeon was most like himself and he had wakened him from a long nap
      this morning, brushing his clothes and placing the papers in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the fifth, sir,&rdquo; he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Simeon had looked at him with a bit of the old, keen smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to meet the directors,&rdquo; said John close in his ear,
      &ldquo;You remember?&rdquo; He looked at him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon had nodded reassuringly. &ldquo;I know. <i>I &rsquo;m</i> all right&mdash;I
      can <i>look</i> all right.&rdquo; He had said it almost like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then John had taken him by the arm and led him to the door of the Room
      and pushed him in. Only at the door had he dared release his hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he need not have feared. To the president of the &ldquo;B. and Q.&rdquo;
      Road, the green table&mdash;with those mighty, iron-bounded men around it&mdash;was
      like a challenge. He had entered the room with positive eclat; and now he
      sat with quiet face listening to the report, a little cynical smile edging
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the look the directors knew well
    </p>
    <p>
      They trusted it as they looked up from their paper.....It was the old,
      dividend look.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eye dropped to it for a moment and his voice quickened a
      little. He had come to a difficult part of the report. It was delicate
      treading here&mdash;&ldquo;Equipment for the coming year: Thirty-nine new
      engines will be needed&mdash;twelve of the big Pacific type, the numbers
      running from 3,517 to 3,528, and ten combination fast freight and
      passenger engines of the 2,000 series. The other seventeen....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the hoard quiver subtly. They stirred in their places. He knew,
      without looking up, the inquiring glances gathering on the impassive face
      at the head of the table.... &ldquo;The other seventeen will be switching
      engines and the heaviest kind of freight engines...&rdquo; The voice went
      quietly on, but his hand had dropped ever so lightly on the shoulder
      beside him as he turned a page of the report. The shoulder straightened
      beneath the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the road looked up and nodded to the swift, darting
      glances&mdash;once&mdash;twice, the old, keen, reassuring look&mdash;intrepid
      and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directors turned the pages with easier fingers, but a new alertness
      was in the air. These were details that any one could grasp&mdash;with
      their implications.... &ldquo;Six hundred box cars&mdash;forty passenger
      coaches, each to cost $6,500.&rdquo; The look of sleepy content was
      banished from the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the president of the road met the glances that traveled toward him,
      with steady front. The figures had startled the directors, but they seemed
      as music in his ears. &ldquo;Thirty-nine engines&mdash;twelve of the big
      Pacific type&mdash;&rdquo; sang to him! He sat a little straighter, his
      quick nod assenting to each detail and vouching for items that might so
      easily have stirred a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directors had no eyes for the young man taking the papers from Tetlow&rsquo;s
      hand, reading them one by one. He was hardly more than a Voice. They did
      not note that the stubby hand as it reached out to take a paper from the
      trembling one closed upon it firmly for a minute and that the hand ceased
      to shake. When the next item was read, the hand lifted itself from the
      table with a little gesture of pride and assent. The proposed improvements
      and equipment would cost a round million,&mdash;But the road could stand a
      million dollars&mdash;and more.... The lifted hand had said this
      eloquently before it dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room breathed more easily, and into the voice that read the items
      there crept a quiet note of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes&mdash;now...
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes....
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the road swayed a little toward the table. He might be
      consulting the paper in his hand&mdash;it was the last one&mdash;before he
      handed it to the sturdy young man beside him to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man leaning toward him to take it, blotted out for a moment the
      thin, bent figure. When his shoulders straightened themselves again, the
      president of the &ldquo;R. and Q.&rdquo; was erect in his chair, his
      inscrutable face turned toward the directors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man read rapidly from the paper. It was a summary of items. They
      had the substance of it already. This only gathered it into smaller
      compass for them, the quiet voice seemed to assure them, as it went
      swiftly to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one point not included in the formal report that the
      President intended to speak to you about.&rdquo; He had laid down the
      paper and was looking at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned the glance, finding a certain pleasure in this sturdy young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon looked up with a little, startled glance.... The hand touched his
      arm carelessly and rested there while the voice went on speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had been President Tetlow&rsquo;s wish to ask for a leave of
      absence&mdash;to take effect at your pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The arm beneath the hand stirred and Simeon &rsquo;s mouth opened with an
      inarticulate sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directors glanced at him with sympathetic, humorous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The senior director was on his feet proposing a motion&mdash;Three other
      directors, all on their feet, were seconding it&mdash;It was carried with
      a little informal hurst of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon rose to his feet. It was as if he thought that he could respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directors were looking at him with expectant faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed toward them and opened his lips&mdash;and broke into a long,
      deep, helpless cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      John put up his hand to the directors, smiling, and escorted him swiftly
      to the door....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pleasant hurry of sound among the directors, a getting into
      light overcoats and shaking of hands, a murmur of dividends, and a rush
      for trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up in the little office Simeon Tetlow stood by the window. He held up his
      hand&mdash;groping, trembling toward the light&mdash;He looked at it, and
      tried to hold it still&mdash;and still looked at it&mdash;the light
      falling faintly through it.... &ldquo;They trust me, John! They trust <i>me!</i>
      But how dare they trust me!&rdquo; The shaking hand flickered its
      quivering, helpless dance against the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man drew it down, covering it with his own. &ldquo;They trust
      you, sir, because you&rsquo;ve never failed them,&rdquo; he said quietly.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he assistant
      bookkeeper was finishing his accounts for the night. He made another entry
      and blotted&rsquo; it before he closed the book and looked up, with a
      little offhand nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man moved toward him. &ldquo;President Tetlow asked me to tell
      you something, Harrington.&rdquo; They were alone in the room, but he
      spoke in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper&rsquo;s shoulders squared themselves a little. He had
      expected this. He had known it would come&mdash;with the directors&rsquo;
      meeting. He jabbed his pen in a cup of shot and lifted his face sullenly.
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; His tone, too, was low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They raised you five hundred at the meeting,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper stared at him. Then his eyes dropped. He studied his nails
      for a minute. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred dollars&mdash;to begin Monday,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookkeeper looked up under his lids, without lifting his head. &ldquo;What
      do you mean?&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited a minute. When he spoke, a little smile edged the words.
      &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to know right off&mdash;So you could
      write the C. B. and L. that you won&rsquo;t be able to do anything for
      them after today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t it work?&rdquo; sneered the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It worked too well,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve lost a
      good twenty thousand these two weeks&mdash;trying to fix it&mdash;and the
      twenty thousand is ours. But we don&rsquo;t do business that way&mdash;not
      unless we have to,&rdquo; he added with slow emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up. &ldquo;How are you going to keep tab on me?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the five hundred keep tab?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s smile was wintry. &ldquo;The C. B. and L. did better,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;they knew what they were paying for&mdash;they thought
      they knew. The &lsquo;R. and Q.&rsquo; does n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stirred a little. &ldquo;All right. It&rsquo;s a go.&rdquo; He
      took up his pen and tried the nib on his thumb nail. His eyes were fixed
      on it. &ldquo;Cheaper to fire me,&rdquo; he said, dipping the pen into the
      ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Wait a minute,
      Harrington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pen paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;R. and Q.&rsquo; will need straight men the next six
      months&mdash;men that will stand by!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded. He was not looking np. &ldquo;I have an idea, somehow&mdash;&rdquo;
      The young man hesitated. Then he laughed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched
      you, you know,&rdquo; he said frankly, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve had an eye on
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of them,&rdquo; said Harrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I &rsquo;ve come to think you may be one of the best men
      the road&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> thought,&rdquo; said the man
      drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you came to be in this C. B. and L. mixup,&rdquo;
      said John quickly, &ldquo;but I think you stood by them as long as you
      could&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and did their dirty work for them,&rdquo; added John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s face clouded a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;R. and Q.&rsquo; wants that kind of men for clean work&mdash;&rdquo;
      He paused, seeking the right words. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m not clever, you
      know,&rdquo; said John. He raised his clear eyes to the man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face sneered a little&mdash;then it changed subtly. &ldquo;I believe
      you &rsquo;re speaking God&rsquo;s truth,&rdquo; he said soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m not clever&mdash;I
      know it. But the road needs men that are&mdash;Men that know enough to be
      rascals and won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at him a minute. Then he laughed&mdash;a long, full laugh.
      It had a hint of fellowship in it.&mdash;&ldquo;You &rsquo;re a rum un,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;It
      &rsquo;sa bargain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated a minute. Then he took the hand. &ldquo;I should think I
      could give five hundred dollars&rsquo; worth of honesty&mdash;and I
      &rsquo;d like to give as much over as I can afford.&rdquo; He said it
      lightly. But there was a little ring to the words, and the sullen look had
      vanished from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said John. He nodded and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant bookkeeper sat staring at the pen in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;A
      rascal,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;but not a fool rascal!&mdash;He said it
      straight, did n&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; He chuckled again. He drew the sheet of
      paper toward him. Then he looked up as if a sudden thought had struck him&mdash;&ldquo;And
      <i>he &rsquo;s</i> no fool either!&rdquo; he said slowly. The pen began
      its letter to the manager of the C. B. and L.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the letter reached the manager, he threw it on his desk with an
      exclamation of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said the superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Backed out,&rdquo; said the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; He consulted the letter. &ldquo;Says
      he&rsquo;s sick of it&mdash;the whole business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virtuous?&mdash;His virtue has n&rsquo;t been of much use the last
      few weeks,&rdquo; suggested the superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody &rsquo;s any use,&rdquo; said the manager tartly. The two
      weeks&rsquo; losses had worn on his nerves.... &ldquo;There &rsquo;s a man
      in that office I should like to get,&rdquo; added the manager after a
      minute. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s young&mdash;sort of a boy. But I &rsquo;ve a
      notion we could use him&mdash;if we knew what he &rsquo;d cost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the C. B. and L. meditated, off and on, the next few days,
      what John would cost. He never arrived at any conclusion that quite
      satisfied him. Just as he had fixed upon the bait that should tempt a
      young man who had his way to make in the world&mdash;a pair of clear blue
      eyes confronted him, shining mistily. There was a deep, still glow about
      that boy when he spoke of Tetlow that made him feel the boy was beyond
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the C. B. and L. was a practical man and when, in the
      process of calculation, he ran up against eyes of a young man, he swore
      softly under his breath.

      XXII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ohn was turning
      the question in his mind all day&mdash;where the president should spend
      his vacation. But each route that he blocked out presented at some point
      an insuperable obstacle, and he was forced hack to the starting point to
      begin over.... The place must be far enough from the road so that Simeon
      would not be reminded of its existence, yet near enough for John to return
      to his mother at an hour&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had watched her with special care in the days that preceded the
      directors&rsquo; meeting.... If she should grow worse and he could not
      leave her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But His mind had come to rest hopefully in the look in her face. She would
      not fail him. She was even more eager than he in planning for his absence&mdash;Caleb
      would be with her, and in the city it was easier than in Bridgewater to
      get help&mdash;the cooking and baking, some of it, could be bought from
      the little white shop around the corner.&mdash;She entered into the plan
      as if the journey were to be made for her sake rather than for Simeon&rsquo;s.
      And John, watching her, knew that she was really better. The change to the
      new house and its surroundings had been good for her. There was even a
      little pink tinge in her cheeks sometimes and she declared that the very
      cracks in the ceiling of the new house were restful to look at as she lay
      in bed. She had never known how full of pain and wakefulness the old
      cracks were until they had been suddenly lifted from her. The new cracks
      should have only hope in them, she said, with a little smile; they should
      be filled with beautiful things&mdash;the light that came in at the east
      window for her&mdash;she had not had an east window at home&mdash;and
      Caleb&rsquo;s pleasure in his new work and in his garden. Her window
      overlooked the garden and she lay for hours looking out at it and at the
      sky.... There was not much in the garden yet. But Caleb pottered about in
      it, setting out the roots and shrubs he had brought from home, preparing
      the asparagus bed and strawberry beds, and trimming up the few trees and
      shrubs that bordered it. He was very contented working in the warm October
      sun inside the high fence. The roots of his being stirred softly, making
      ready to strike down into the new mold and rest there gently as they had
      rested in the old garden at home. By spring he would hardly know the
      change&mdash;any more than the daffodils and the jonquils that he had
      planted in a corner by the fence with some lilies of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been at work in the garden the day of the directors&rsquo; meeting,
      and he watched the Boy as he came slowly up the street, his head bent in
      thought. Caleb gathered up his tools with little regretful, backward
      looks. He had meant to set out that last row of asparagus tonight&mdash;But
      it was late and the boy looked tired. He set the asparagus plants in the
      little shed he had improvised for his tools and covered them carefully
      against the night air. Then he went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother and the Boy were talking in the next room softly and he thought
      he would not disturb them. He fussed about, setting the table and making
      tea. Even when they were seated at table, Caleb paid little heed to what
      was being said; his mind was still digging in the garden, out in the soft
      mold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a word caught his ear and he looked up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you
      were saying, Johnny&mdash;about a farm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s about President Tetlow. He has to go away, you know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Caleb&rsquo;s interest relaxed. &ldquo;I thought it was something about a
      farm.&rdquo; He returned to his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I wished there were some farm he could go to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farms enough,&rdquo; said Caleb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know a good one?&rdquo; The boy and his mother both leaned
      forward. They had turned the question over and over; they had not once
      thought of Caleb who knew the region by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chewed slowly. &ldquo;There &rsquo;s a place up Chester County way,&rdquo;
      he said at last, his eyes fixed on it as he chewed. &ldquo;I used to work
      there when I was a boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too far away,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to be nearby, do ye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not too near the railroad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Caleb&rsquo;s slow mind started on its new quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There &rsquo;s a place up from Bridgewater a ways&mdash;It &rsquo;s
      off the road. You might hear a toot clear nights, maybe&mdash;but much as
      ever&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Caleb shook his head. &ldquo;Nice folks <i>used</i> to live there&mdash;the
      Griswolds&mdash;but I heerd somewhere &rsquo;t they&rsquo;d sold&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick look shot into the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean
      the old Bardwell farm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; said Caleb&mdash;&ldquo;I was
      thinking about that little house on the creek, about half a mile, cross
      lots, from the farmhouse. Anybody &rsquo;d be quiet enough there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tomlinsons are there,&rdquo; said John thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There by the creek!&rdquo; asked Caleb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, in the farmhouse. I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s anybody
      in the little house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be fitted up,&rdquo; said his mother quickly. &ldquo;That
      &rsquo;s better than boarding; and you must not do the work&mdash;with all
      that will come on you besides. Mrs. Tomlinson would cook for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen Tomlinson is a powerful good cook,&rdquo; said Caleb
      solemnly. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve et her victuals many a time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll go down tomorrow,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;We can have
      the little house, I know&mdash;It belongs to the road&mdash;and I &rsquo;ll
      put in a few camping things. If Ellen won&rsquo;t cook for us, we &rsquo;ll
      make shift somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not do it,&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good air,&rdquo; said Caleb, &ldquo;&mdash;High up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very still there&mdash;the top of the world,&rdquo; said his
      mother with a little flitting sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the place,&rdquo; said John. Then he hesitated a
      minute. Hugh Tomlinson&rsquo;s face had suddenly flashed before him&mdash;the
      red-rimmed eyes and the high, quavering voice.... Would Simeon object to
      his presence? He had always refused to speak of Tomlinson and he was
      gruffly silent when his name was mentioned.... But he had put him on the
      farm&mdash;rent-free&mdash;and he had sent the cheque&mdash;a thousand
      dollars.... John weighed the chances... and even while he hesitated, an
      instinct deeper than reason told him that the old Scotchman&rsquo;s
      presence must be concealed from Simeon.... He might not mind. But there
      must be no risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll go down to see the
      Tomlinsons and get the house ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Scotchman surveyed him with keen eyes. &ldquo;He wants to come
      here?&mdash;Sim Tetlow wants to come <i>here</i>&mdash;to this farm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;He &rsquo;ll be at the little
      house&mdash;down by the creek, you know.&rdquo; The switchman was silent
      for a little. &ldquo;A man can do what he likes wi&rsquo; his own,&rdquo;
      he said at last gruffly. &ldquo;He owns the farm&mdash;I &rsquo;ll go&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; John said quickly. &ldquo;We need
      some one to cook for us&mdash;good nourishing food&mdash;and I was going
      to ask your wife&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s eyes still pierced him. &ldquo;Ye think Sim Tetlow
      &rsquo;ll get well on food &rsquo;t my Ellen &rsquo;d cook?&mdash;Choke
      him!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited a minute. &ldquo;I was n&rsquo;t going to tell him who cooked
      it&mdash;I thought he did n&rsquo;t need to know.&rdquo; He turned and
      looked at the man beside him. &ldquo;He needs all the help we can give
      him, Hugh. He&rsquo;s desperate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow, deep smile had come into the Scotch eyes&mdash;They glimmered to
      little points and sought the distant horizon. &ldquo;He must e&rsquo;en
      take his fate,&rdquo; said the old man grimly, &ldquo;wi&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo;
      us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can help him,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I feel it. <i>You</i>
      can help&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll do naught for him,&rdquo; said the man sternly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      within door, and ye can ask <i>her</i>. If she &rsquo;ll cook for Sim
      Tetlow, I &rsquo;ll bide by what she says. I &rsquo;ll not lift a hand to
      hinder&mdash;or help.&rdquo; He moved toward the bam, walking with huge
      strides, like some grim, implacable fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      John watched him for a moment. Then he turned and knocked on the farmhouse
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he lifted the latch, the little old woman by the stove looked up,
      bending gentle eyes upon him. She set down the frying-pan and came
      forward, The smile in her face like the October sunshine outside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      Johnny Bennett,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I was telling Hugh, but the
      morning, I&rsquo;d be glad to see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took the outstretched hand with a sudden lifting of heart.
      He forgot the gaunt figure striding from him and saw only the gentle,
      wrinkled face in its prim Scotch cap, beaming with light.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a dozen words he had laid the story before her. She listened with
      intent eyes, her fingers plaiting the edge of her apron in tiny folds.
      When he had finished, the apron dropped from her fingers and she smoothed
      the pleats one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a hard man to us, Johnny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I &rsquo;ll do it for ye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would.&rdquo; It came from a full heart, and she smiled
      a little to him as she gave a final, smoothing touch to the apron. &ldquo;He
      sent us the check, and it was bitter bread we bought wi&rsquo; it. But the
      bread I bake for him will be sweet,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Ellen.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s
      good in you to do it, and what money can pay for&mdash;you shall have, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money won&rsquo;t pay for the bread I shall bake him, Johnny,&rdquo;
      she said slowly. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s welcome to it and may the Lord
      bless it&mdash;to him.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IMEON Tetlow, in
      the little house by the creek, was growing stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been days of waiting-long, slow days, when he sat dully passive,
      staring before him, or lay on the camp bed in a deep sleep. When he woke,
      he took the food that John brought him and fell asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, unseen fingers had come in the silence and smoothed the
      lines from the sleeping face, touching the fevered cheeks to coolness....
      He slept now like a child, breathing lightly, and when he woke, his eyes
      were clear and fresh&mdash;only somewhere in the depths lurked a little
      shadow that nothing could efface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow kept tally on their days. When it lightened, John&rsquo;s heart
      sang, and when it deepened, he set himself anew to his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first days he had not left his patient night or day&mdash;except
      for brief journeys across the woodlot to the farmhouse to bring the food
      that Ellen cooked. Later, when Simeon was able to walk a little and needed
      less care, he had made occasional trips to the office of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during one of these trips that a new factor had entered into the
      case. The young man had been gone since early morning and the house was
      very quiet, deepening in the long silence to a kind of presence. The
      October sun poured in at the windows and a late fly buzzed in the light on
      the pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon glanced at it. Then he went and stood by the window looking out.
      His eye traveled along the little path that lost itself in the bushes and
      undergrowth at the left. It was a path that John had unwittingly worn in
      his daily journeys to the farmhouse. But Simeon did not know this, he did
      not even know that it was a path. He did not guess that along it a child
      was trudging, bringing him health in both her fat little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back and sat down by the fire, sighing a little. It was an open
      fire that blazed and crackled, and as he watched it he dozed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand on the latch startled him and he sat up&mdash;awake.... John was
      early.... He turned his expectant face to the door. It swung open
      silently, as if unseen hands had pushed it, and he sprang up trembling.
      ... No one was there.... Then his eye dropped a little and he stood still&mdash;staring
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very little, and she was very round and fat, and her cheeks
      laughed and her curls danced, and her stout little legs, in their heavy
      stockings, had a sturdy sense of achievement. She looked at him gravely.
      Then she turned and placing both hands on the door pushed it shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not stirred from his place. His eyes were following her, half
      doubting.... She was not more real than some of the visions that had
      haunted his tired eyes.... But much more charming!
    </p>
    <p>
      She confronted the closed door for a moment with a little air of triumph.
      Then she nodded at it and turned and came toward him across the room, her
      face lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still he did not speak. He had moistened his lips a little with his
      tongue and his breath came quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself on a packing box that served as a chair and crossed her
      fat legs at the ankle. She nodded gravely. &ldquo;I am Ellen,&rdquo; she
      said in a clear, sweet voice, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moistened his lips again, still staring. Then a humorous light crept
      into his eyes. &ldquo;I am&mdash;Simeon,&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded again. &ldquo;I like Cinnamon. Granny makes them&mdash;round
      ones&mdash;cookies. I like &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is Grannie?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is&mdash;Grannie,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;Do you live
      here?&rdquo; Her direct eyes were on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;live&mdash;here.&rdquo; He said the words slowly and a
      little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does your work?&rdquo; she asked promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned toward her, very serious. &ldquo;A fairy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped from the box and came toward him, her face aglow. &ldquo;Where
      is it?&rdquo; she demanded. She stood before him very straight&mdash;courage
      and health and belief in every line of the swift little body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He half put out a hand, but she stirred a little and he withdrew it,
      leaning back in his chair and gazing with half-shut eyes into the flame.
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see a fairy, you know,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had bent forward, a hand on either knee, peering intently into the
      fire. She straightened herself&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it?&rdquo;
      she asked. &ldquo;Not ever?&rdquo; A disappointed look was in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;They come at night, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The brown eyes searched his face. Then the curls wagged from side to side.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Brownie that comes at night,&rdquo; she said
      reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked his surprise. &ldquo;Is it, indeed&mdash;a Brownie!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Grannie told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She came nearer and placed her little fat hand on his knee. &ldquo;I like
      you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely breathed and his face, as he leaned back in the chair, was
      very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tipped forward and peered into it. &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; she
      asked. It was almost a whisper&mdash;solicitous, but firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. The tired eyes opened and looked at her, full of a kind
      of sweet light. &ldquo;I am&mdash;resting,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nestled a little nearer to him, carelessly, and looked into the fire.
      Presently she hummed to herself....a little crooning song&mdash;half
      words, half happiness: Then she left him and wandered about the room,
      touching things with grave, respectful touches, but with liveliest
      curiosity in the peering brown eyes. When she had finished, she went
      toward the door. &ldquo;I am going, now,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dared not put out a finger to stay her and his eyes did not lift
      themselves from the flames. &ldquo;Come again,&rdquo; he said carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. It was a very grave little word&mdash;full
      of assurance and comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she opened the door and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire flared in the sudden gust and he looked around. The door&mdash;too
      heavy for her to close&mdash;swung wide to the October sun, and down the
      path the sturdy brown figure was trudging, holding intent on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon moved to the door and stood looking after it. The sun shone
      clear.... Everywhere the serene, level light and in the midst of it,
      moving steadily on, a quaint, sturdy figure.... He put up his hand
      impatiently, brushing aside something that hindered his gaze. When he
      withdrew the hand, he looked down at it and thrust it out of sight,
      perplexed and savage and stirred.... &ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m growing soft!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door and went back to the seat by the fire, wondering a
      little that he should care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not come,&rdquo; he said as he looked into the deep coals.
      But in his heart he knew. She came again and again&mdash;sometimes every
      day and sometimes with long intervals between. When this occurred, Simeon
      would grow restless and go often to the window to look where the path
      emerged from the undergrowth. It never seemed to occur to him to follow
      the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had showed, from the first, a curious indifference to his surroundings.
      They had not come by the way of Bridgewater, but had left the train at a
      small station farther up the road and driven across country eight or ten
      miles, by night, to the Bardwell farm and the little house on the creek.
      To Simeon, in the long empty days that followed his arrival, the place had
      no existence. He hardly knew more than that he ate and slept and that John
      was always at hand&mdash;to turn his pillow or speak to him or replace the
      light coverlet when it slipped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as strength came to him and they walked every day a little distance
      from the house, his indifference to the outer world persisted. He asked no
      questions. His mind followed no roads. Sometimes on misty nights, when the
      long, slow whistle sounded across the low hills, John would watch him
      curiously. But the head was not lifted from the brooding hand by the fire.
      The road had slipped out of memory, perhaps&mdash;or grown dim in the
      visions that haunted his gaze. If he knew where John went, on the days
      when he was absent, he made no reference to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when the child came, his mind reached out. It reached out to a little
      path that lost itself in the underbrush and rustling oak leaves. He would
      stand for hours, looking at it wistfully when she did not come. But he
      never set foot in the path. It was hers and she came and went as she
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a kind of canny Scotch wisdom, the child had refrained from speaking
      at home of her visits. She may have been uneasily afraid that they would
      be forbidden if discovered, and she concealed them carefully, not only
      from her grandparents, but from her little brother who was her only
      companion. It was not always easy to evade him and, then, there were days
      when she did not come. But she guarded Simeon&rsquo;s secret jealously, as
      if he were some helpless thing she had come upon unawares in her trudgings
      up and down the farm. And from the day she first strayed into the
      half-defined path that John&rsquo;s feet had worn between the house and
      the farm, she did not cease to haunt it.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT are you doing?&rdquo;
      She was standing on tiptoe, her eyes barely over the edge of the table,
      watching Simeon&rsquo;s pencil as it moved over the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pencil continued its curious tracks. Simeon&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on
      it intently. There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched it a few minutes in silence. She and Simeon were good friends.
      They did not mind the silence, but he would answer&mdash;if he heard&mdash;&ldquo;What
      are you doing?&rdquo; It was very quiet&mdash;but firm&mdash;in the clear,
      high voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down. Then he smiled into the level eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      drawing a map,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found a chair and pushed it to the table. She climbed into it and
      knelt with her fat arms folded in front of her on the table, bending
      toward the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon paid no heed to her. The pencil went its absent-minded way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no unusual thing for them to be silent a long while, with an
      occasional smile or nod between them, she intent on grave matters, Simeon
      following hazy, wavering thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had never chosen to make pictures. This was something important and
      different. She leaned closer, her shoulder touching his. &ldquo;Is that a
      pig?&rdquo; she asked politely. Her finger indicated a shape in one
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a mountain,&rdquo; said Simeon. He sketched in a tree or
      two to verify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s a funny mountain,&rdquo; she said. She drew in her
      breath a little, watching the pencil respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is full of beautiful things,&rdquo; said Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent closer to examine it. &ldquo;Can you see them?&rdquo; She lifted
      serious eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see them&mdash;very plain. There is iron and copper and lead&mdash;&rdquo;
      his pencil touched the paper, here and there, in little dots, &ldquo;and
      silver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And gold&mdash;&rdquo; said the child in a soft, monotonous voice.
      They were playing a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much gold, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Simeon, shaking his
      head, &ldquo;but it is a wonderful mountain full of beautiful things&mdash;that
      can&rsquo;t get out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why</i> can&rsquo;t they get out?&rdquo; she demanded as if some
      foolish mystery lay behind his talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment. &ldquo;A bad man keeps them there,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;He has the key.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he <i>let</i> &rsquo;em out?&rdquo; It was a shrewd
      little wondering, groping question toward the truth, but it was full of
      sing-song happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nestled closer while the pencil went its way, drawing two long lines
      that stretched side by side across the paper. They readied the mountain
      and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a railroad that the bad man will build,&rdquo; he said,
      putting in some extra lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      They watched the pencil in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a bad man,&rdquo; she said idly, as if it were not
      important, but worth mentioning since it concerned Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; The surprise in the tone was partly real. &ldquo;Do
      <i>you</i> know a bad man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know one.&rdquo; It was a modest little drawl&mdash;an
      assertion of wisdom tinged with importance. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a <i>very</i>
      bad man,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-teasing note did not touch her. &ldquo;He kills folks&mdash;He
      killed my father,&rdquo; she said tersely. The words were light on her
      tongue, but she nodded to him with deep serious eyes that his could not
      fathom. Something in the eyes hurt him&mdash;a kind of trust and ignorance
      and deep appeal. He put his arm protectingly about the little form,
      drawing it close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not say things like that, Ellen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gran&rsquo;ther says it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>you</i> must not.... You will not say it again&mdash;?&rdquo;
      It was half a command. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever say it again, Ellen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o&mdash;&rdquo; It was reassuring and polite-half drawled;
      and it dismissed the subject idly&mdash;They had dwelt on it too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the key?&rdquo; She was dipping toward the paper, peering
      close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The key?&rdquo; He stared a little&mdash;&ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;This
      is the key.&rdquo; His pencil touched the parallel lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &rsquo;s a railroad,&rdquo; she said promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;It is the key, too&mdash;See&mdash;&rdquo; He drew more
      lines rapidly, &ldquo;When this touches the mountain, the iron and silver
      will come pouring out and it will run down this track&mdash;here, and here&mdash;&rdquo;
      The pencil moved fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed it with grave eyes. She drew a deep breath and leaned closer
      to him. She lifted her face with a smile. It had caught the glow in his&mdash;but
      she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell to sketching again and she nestled in his arm. By-and-by she put
      out a short finger. &ldquo;Does folks live there&mdash;or Brownies!&rdquo;
      she said, half whispering the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up absently&mdash;&ldquo;Where&mdash;Oh&mdash;on the mountain?&mdash;People
      live there&mdash;I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ever seen them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;still absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed a little. &ldquo;I like folks,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He paused in his thought and looked at her with a
      smile&mdash;tolerant and old&mdash;&ldquo;You like folks, do you?&rdquo;
      The look teased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded gravely. &ldquo;They &rsquo;ll be glad&mdash;&rdquo; Her finger
      was tapping at the mountain&mdash;&ldquo;They &rsquo;ll <i>like</i> to
      have the beautiful things come <i>pouring out</i>&mdash;&rdquo; She spread
      her hands with a little gesture of beneficent plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her a minute&mdash;then he laughed. &ldquo;I suppose they
      will.... I had n&rsquo;t thought of it.&rdquo; His eyes dwelt on her
      fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&mdash;They &rsquo;ll like it.&mdash;They &rsquo;re nice folks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do <i>you</i> know?&mdash;You seen them?&rdquo; They often
      played like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She nodded wisely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s fahvers and
      muwers and little uns&mdash;bairns-like me.&rdquo; She was looking at
      something far away&mdash;Then her eyes flashed back to his. &ldquo;They
      &rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; she said swiftly, &ldquo;They &rsquo;ll help&mdash;They
      &rsquo;ll bring out the beautiful things&mdash;great handfuls!&rdquo; She
      threw them out with her lavish little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught them both in one of his. But he was not looking at her. He was
      seeing something far off... something the child&rsquo;s words made him
      see.... He looked at it so long that one of the hands freed itself and
      reached up to the intent face, stroking it.... Then he looked down and saw
      her. He smiled at her&mdash;with deep eyes... with the little shadow
      playing in them&mdash;far back.... &ldquo;So you love folks?&rdquo; he
      said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must e&rsquo;en love everybody,&rdquo; she repeated as if it
      were a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody?&rdquo; He looked at her, a little startled at the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clear eyes lifted themselves&mdash;&ldquo;Gran-&rsquo;ther says we
      must do justice to all men,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;But Grannie
      says we must forgi&rsquo;e &rsquo;em&mdash;she says we must e&rsquo;en <i>love</i>
      &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must love him&mdash;the bad man.&rdquo; He said the words
      half teasingly, half gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face clouded. But the eyes were untroubled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fink
      <i>anybody</i> loves <i>him</i>,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;But
      Grannie says we e&rsquo;en must.&rdquo; She gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I love him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was full of her ignorance&mdash;a kind of sing-song chant, but
      somehow it gripped him strangely.... As if he heard in some inner world&mdash;faint,
      ringing little bells of joy and sadness and the mystery of life.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e sat in front of
      the fire brooding absently. He had been alone all day&mdash;ever since
      John left in the early morning. The boy was coming back tonight. He had
      said that he would come&mdash;but that Simeon must not wait for him; he
      must go to bed as usual. It was late now, but Simeon in front of the fire
      waited impatiently.... A strange loneliness was on him. Outside the snow
      had been falling fitfully all day. The ground was covered with still
      whiteness. Across the waste of snow he heard a distant clock strike softly
      and far away&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten&mdash;and still he waited,
      brooding there by the fire. He wanted to see some one&mdash;to touch a
      friendly hand&mdash;before he fell into the deep sleep that would cut him
      off. A strange yearning toward his fellowmen had come upon him in the last
      days. The child&rsquo;s words followed him wistfully&mdash;&ldquo;We must
      e&rsquo;en love &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, wondering at
      the strange tugging at his heart&mdash;Tiny cords seemed to reach out from
      him, threading their way, spreading wide-seeking men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and paced the little room. He was not the man who had entered it
      ten weeks ago&mdash;broken, helpless in weakness. His step on the floor
      was firm and the hand that reached out to the tongs was steady in its
      grip. He readjusted a log in the fireplace and replaced the tongs. Then he
      stood looking down at the fire. He had grown fond of the flames&mdash;leaping
      there. He would miss them when he went back to his office&mdash;and the
      cold town house. He glanced about the little room affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... The boy had filled it with love and thoughtfulness from the first day.
      It was sweet now with pine and spruce and hemlock&mdash;fastened
      everywhere&mdash;running along the walls and heaped in corners. The boy
      had brought it in from the woods for Christmas Day. The scent of it was
      like the woods themselves&mdash;Something mysterious and deep was in the
      room. The woods were in the room. The man breathed deep and looked around
      him.... How he would miss it all.... But his work was waiting... and he
      was ready. He stretched out an arm straight from the shoulder and looked
      with quiet pride at the hand. It did not quiver, by a breath, from its
      place. The arm dropped at his side.... He was ready... almost. The shadow
      flickered across his face. It retreated to his eyes and crouched ...
      waiting. He sat down before the andirons and looked defiantly into the hot
      coals.... Some senseless, half-crazed words mumbled at him.... He shrugged
      his shoulder.... He would not hear them. The firm hand had clinched itself
      on his knee.... A face grew out of the fire, red-eyed and old and
      imbecile. It swung before his gaze full of hatred and leering malice, and
      the clinched hand lifted itself. ... The face was fading, line by line, in
      the flickering light. The mumbled words grew faint. They sank to a
      whisper... and died away. ... It was the voice of the child&mdash;clear
      and low, &ldquo;We must e&rsquo;en forgi&rsquo;e &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank hack, wiping the heads from his forehead. He stared before him&mdash;seeking
      a way out.... He had offered the man money.... He had given him the farm,
      free of rent&mdash;and it was a good farm, they said&mdash;the Bardwell
      farm&mdash;Was it not enough?... He brooded on it, sitting there. The
      loneliness outside crept into the room.... The snow had ceased to fall,
      and through the uncurtained window he caught a glimpse of light shining.
      He got up and went to the window and looked out. The white clouds seemed
      to be being drawn across the sky by unseen hands; beyond them the stars
      shone clear. The snowy landscape glowed faint beneath them.... Suddenly he
      uttered an exclamation and turned away. He crossed quickly to the door and
      threw it open and stood peering out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little figure was coming up the path, nodding and blowing&mdash;Her
      curls were afloat and her little face glowed in the light from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; she panted heavily, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve
      got here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you had.&rdquo; His voice was stern. But he had
      gathered her in his arms, holding her close. She struggled a little and he
      set her down. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m wet,&rdquo; she announced&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      most wet fru, I guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He found some old underclothing of John&rsquo;s and took off the wet
      things, holding them up, one by one, to the light and looking at her
      reproachfully. She had come apparently in her nightdress, with the
      addition of an extra shirt, one stocking, one legging, a pair of overshoes
      and her little fur coat and cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could n&rsquo;t find my Fings,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;not
      all of my fings&mdash;in the dark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come for?&rdquo; asked Simeon severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rosy happiness precluded sentiment&mdash;and kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the glowing fire and then at his face. She looked down at
      her pink toes, peeping from below John&rsquo;s drawers&mdash;The drawers
      wrinkled grotesquely on the fat legs and she tried to hold them up a
      little as she approached him, humbly.... Simeon was angry&mdash;She could
      see it from the tail of her eye, as she drew nearer with downcast head.
      &ldquo;I wanted to see Santa Claus,&rdquo; she said. She had come very
      close now and she put out a fat hand, resting it on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent a little toward her. &ldquo;You should have waited till tomorrow,
      child. Don&rsquo;t you know I shall have to take you back&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a stricken face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;in the cold and snow,&rdquo; went on Simeon unheeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lip quivered. With a bound she had buried her face in his breast.&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      take me, Cinnamon!&rdquo; she wailed&mdash;&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t take
      me&mdash;back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your grandfather and grandmother will worry&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a reassuring, streaming face, &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t <i>know</i>
      about me,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I am sound asleep.&rdquo; She snuffed
      a little and fumbled in the capacious folds of John&rsquo;s undershirt for
      a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon produced his and she accepted it meekly. She wiped her cheeks with
      it and stowed it away. &ldquo;I peeked&mdash;&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in
      the door and they was asleep&mdash;both of &rsquo;em&mdash;and Gran&rsquo;ther
      was a-snorin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they wake up,&rdquo; said Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him piteously. &ldquo;Santa Claus can&rsquo;t come to our
      house,&rdquo; she said. Her lip trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &rsquo;ve shut up the chimbley.&rdquo; She moved a fat hand
      toward the fireplace&mdash;&ldquo;I cried about it,&rdquo; she explained,
      &ldquo;and then I went to sleep&mdash;I prayed too, but that did n&rsquo;t
      do any good,&rdquo; she threw in. &ldquo;And then I waked up in the dark
      and &rsquo;membered you, and that&rsquo;s how I come.&rdquo; She nestled
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arms were close around her. &ldquo;You shall stay till the clock
      strikes twelve&mdash;that&rsquo;s when he comes&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I &rsquo;ll carry you home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank back with a little sigh of content. The pink toes cuddled
      themselves in the warm folds and the moist eyes rested dreamily on the
      coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon, holding her in his arms, had a sense of life&mdash;its goodness
      and fullness. The loneliness had fled from the little room. It was filled
      with love, and the world outside was full of friendliness&mdash;It held
      them close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child stirred a little. &ldquo;We did n&rsquo;t hung up my stocking,&rdquo;
      she said drowsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon looked down at the stocking steaming with faint warmth from the
      fire. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s too wet,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She roused herself and sat up&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I have no
      stockings?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. Then he got up and brought one of his own and suspended it
      from the corner of the shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      She surveyed it with dubious content. A little question flitted, and she
      raised an anxious, startled face. &ldquo;He might fink it was yours,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; said Simeon, &ldquo;the minute he
      comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I &rsquo;ll</i> tell him.&rdquo; The eyes had flashed wide. They
      shone dizzily&mdash;the little hands clasped themselves&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I
      &rsquo;ll</i> tell him,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat very straight, her gaze fixed on the exact spot where he should
      come.... Her shoulders drooped a little, but she caught them at it and
      shook them sternly. Then the eyes blinked&mdash;once&mdash;twice, and the
      brown curls nodded. The watching figure was sinking inch by inch into the
      great folds that enwrapped it. She lifted a heavy, dreamy face to Simeon&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t keep&mdash;awake&mdash;Cinnamon,&rdquo; she breathed&mdash;very
      wistful&mdash;with little jerks between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, dear.&rdquo; He laid a hand on the bending head.
      &ldquo;Go to sleep. I &rsquo;ll wake you when he comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a deep sigh, the head sank against the strong shoulder. The firelight
      played across the little figure in its clumsy garments; it touched the
      sleeping face and tipped the nodding curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon watched it, the world in his heart speaking low.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>&rsquo; ve lighted
      the lantern for ye, Hugh.&rdquo; The rays of the lantern shone on the
      meek, wrinkled face, bringing out faint lines and lighting up the
      yellow-white hair that framed it. The hair was a little rough from the
      pillow. She had not thought to smooth it since&mdash;wakened by some inner
      voice&mdash;she had risen to see that all was well with the bairns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She &rsquo;s been long gone,&rdquo; she said, looking up to him as
      he drew on his great mittens and reached for the lantern. &ldquo;The
      pillow was cold.&rdquo; The face beneath the wrinkled lines tried hard to
      hold itself steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re not to worrit, Ellen. I &rsquo;ll find her. I &rsquo;ll
      bring her back.&rdquo; He had thrown open the door and the cold air rushed
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank a little from it, staring at the dark. &ldquo;She &rsquo;ll be
      fey,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;wi&rsquo; the cold and wet and dark. I must
      have the kettle hot.&rdquo; She turned toward the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped to examine the snow in the light from the door. Then he lifted
      himself, a look of satisfaction in the grim face. &ldquo;Shut the door,
      Ellen,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll follow &rsquo;em now in the
      dark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She came quavering. &ldquo;Can ye see, Hugh!&rdquo; She strained her eyes
      toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can follow&mdash;wi&rsquo;
      this.&rdquo; He lifted the lantern a little and she saw the old face,
      stern and hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut the door and watched through the window as the great figure
      lunged away. The lantern swayed from side to side with the huge strides,
      as if a drunken man carried it across the wastes. But the lantern went
      straight. It was making for the oak wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky overhead was sown thick with stars, flung like a royal canopy
      above the earth. The shepherds keeping watch over their flocks would have
      needed no other light to guide them, and Hugh Tomlinson, stooping to the
      little fat tracks that spudded through the snow, had little need of the
      lantern that swung from his great hand. The tracks led straight across the
      country without swerving to left or right. They crossed the wood and came
      into the open.... He followed them fiercely, like a great dog, unheeding
      whither they might lead. Suddenly, with a muffled cry, he stopped....
    </p>
    <p>
      Straight before him ran the creek and out from the bank stretched a frail
      band of ice. Beyond&mdash;the water swirled black and sluggish. He hurried
      to the brink and stood staring&mdash;not a sound to break the silence. He
      strained his eyes across the thin edge of ice. Surely it could not have
      borne the weight of a tiny child. He wheeled about and looked up to the
      stars. They twinkled in their places&mdash;remote and glad. There was no
      help in them. Slowly his eyes dropped.... He started&mdash;shading them,
      as if from a vision, peering forward. There in the window of the little
      house, gleamed a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode forward blindly, his eyes fixed on it. As he drew near, he sank
      to his knees, creeping almost on all fours; but at the window he clutched
      the sill and raised himself.... Within the green-trimmed room with its
      glinting light and soft glow sat the man and the child&mdash;asleep before
      the fire. The child&rsquo;s head rested against the man&rsquo;s breast and
      his face drooped till his cheek touched the modeling curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Hugh Tomlinson eyed the sweet scene&mdash;like some gaunt
      wolf at the window. Then he strode to the door and throwing it open
      entered without knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the fire looked up with startled glance. He had been dreaming,
      and it might have been an apparition of his dream that loomed in, out of
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men regarded each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gaunt one stepped forward a pace. &ldquo;Gi&rsquo;e her to me,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;She belongs to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought she was mine,&rdquo; said Simeon. A sad little smile
      played about his lips. He moved toward the man, holding out his hand.
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Tomlinson,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman did not touch the outstretched hand. He looked down at it
      dourly. &ldquo;Gi&rsquo;e her to me,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as they stood confronting each other, the bells rang.... They
      sounded faint across the snowy waste, striking the hour. The last stroke
      died upon the air, and silence settled in the little room&mdash;with
      greenness and the scent of firs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace on earth, good-will toward men,&rdquo; said Simeon in a low
      voice. &ldquo;Make it peace for me, Hugh Tomlinson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gi&rsquo;e her to me,&rdquo; said Tomlinson again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man made no reply, but the child reached up a sleepy hand and slipped
      it about his neck. &ldquo;I love Cinnamon,&rdquo; she said drowsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Scotchman came nearer. The bony hand did not lift itself from his
      side and there was no softening of the grim face&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord do
      unto ye as ye have done unto me and mine, Simeon Tetlow,&rdquo; he said
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out his arms for the child and the man surrendered her to them&mdash;gently,
      that the sleeping lids might not wake. The old Scotchman gathered her in,
      close&mdash;the folds of his great-coat wrapped protectingly about her.
      Then, his eyes bent hungrily upon her, without a backward look, he went
      out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon Tetlow watched him go, with quiet smile. His hands had dropped to
      his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts played across the thin face&mdash;gleams of light and humor and
      gentleness. He lifted his head, with a quick glance about the fragrant
      room. The fire had died down, but a soft light glowed everywhere. He sat
      down holding out his hands to the warmth, the quiet smile still resting on
      his face and the shadow in the eyes fading before it, flickering away to
      its place in the night. The eyes shone with swift, new light; it played
      upon the face as it bent to the coals&mdash;the intent, human eyes gazing
      at something there.... Slowly the vision lifted itself&mdash;shining rails
      gleamed upon the night. They lay upon the land, the silvery tracings
      branching left and right. A white light shone from them. Simeon Tetlow,
      looking with rapt gaze, saw a new world. The curse could not touch him
      here.... It could never touch him again. Something cold and hard had
      snapped at a word. The forgiveness he had begged of the stern Scotchman
      had come to him... . There had been no curse... only the hardness and
      bitterness in his heart&mdash;that would not say &ldquo;Forgive.&rdquo;
      The word had lingered at the door of his lips through weeks of pain and
      the darkness&mdash;wandering rebellion, sick fancies.... &ldquo;Forgive
      me, Hugh.&rdquo; He had said it&mdash;low and humble, unawares, out of the
      depths... and suddenly he had stood erect. &ldquo;Forgive me, Hugh.&rdquo;
      He whispered it again, looking into the deep coals. ... Troops of faces
      filed before him and he stretched out dumb hands to them. The coals
      deepened and spread, and the great road lay among them. His eyes rested on
      it wistfully. A still, clear light was on the country-side.... Miles of
      wheat and corn, great tracks of prairie, mountains of ore&mdash;lighted by
      it. But his eye swept them as a bird sweeps river and wood and plain in
      its homing flight.... The light was falling on the faces of men and women
      and children and the faces were turned to <i>him</i>&mdash;waiting. The
      coals had died to a tiny spark. He rose and put on fresh wood and the
      flames leaped and ran up the green walls. He fell to musing again.... The
      dream held him.... Life opened.... Softly the bells were ringing in that
      other world.... Little peals that broke and rang&mdash;great swinging
      bells. He bent his head to the sound. It grew, and died away to lightest
      touch and rang again, clear and fresh.... It was nearer now... nearer&mdash;He
      turned his head. The sound had stopped&mdash;at the very door&mdash;The
      boy had come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could rise from his place, the door swung open to the freshness
      of the night and the boy was at his side.... &ldquo;Merry Christmas, sir.&rdquo;
      He bent swiftly to the lifted, smiling face&mdash;&ldquo;You are better,&rdquo;
      he cried, bending nearer in the flickering light, doubting and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am <i>well</i>, John!&rdquo; He was on his feet, both hands
      outstretched to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood thus, the fire leaping on their faces, their hands clasped. ...
      Then they drew apart smiling.... The man moved his hand toward the dusky,
      fragrant room. &ldquo;I am ready to go,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young face lighted. &ldquo;We need you, sir. We need you the worst
      way!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the office?&rdquo; Simeon motioned to a chair. &ldquo;Sit down&mdash;Tell
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head. &ldquo;Not tonight.&rdquo; He looked at his
      watch. &ldquo;It is after one. You must sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sleep,&rdquo; said Simeon contentedly. &ldquo;And tomorrow
      we will talk it over,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow we will go,&rdquo; said the man.

      XXVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he old Scotchman,
      striding through the snow, was holding the child fiercely to him. She had
      not stirred since he folded the great coat about her and he felt the
      warmth nestling there close to his heart. But the heart beat hot and
      resentful. Under his breath he swore and muttered as he stumbled through
      the wood, straying from the path and finding it again with gaunt step. The
      lantern gripped in his tense hand would have lighted the faint track
      through the snow. But he did not look down. His eyes were on a light that
      glimmered and shifted among the trees, shining across the long fields of
      snow beyond.... Ellen was waiting, her heart sore for the bairn. He
      clasped the little form closer and strode on-bitterness in his heart....
      &ldquo;Curse him&mdash;!&rdquo; He had robbed them of work and their good
      name and now he would take the child ... luring her from them through the
      dark and cold, making her love him. The great arms strained her close as
      he stumbled on, coming with each uncertain step nearer to the glimmering
      light till it fell full in his face from the uncurtained window and he
      flung open the door and strode in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with quick glance. Then a little cry broke from her&mdash;&ldquo;Ye
      did na&rsquo; find her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the great-coat where she lay like a flower, and the grandmother
      came close bending to the soft vision. Her hand touched the limp one that
      hung down, its soft, pink palm upturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little hand!&rdquo; she whispered like a slow caress, &ldquo;It
      &rsquo;s warm, Hugh!&rdquo; She lifted her eyes to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;warm.&rdquo; There was no light in the stern face.
      &ldquo;Ye best put her in bed.&rdquo; He held her out&mdash;a little from
      him&mdash;and the child stirred. Her sleepy eyes opened and smiled to them
      and closed slowly. The little smile faded to a dream and the lips groped
      with words and breathed a name softly&mdash;&ldquo;Cin-na-mon&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandmother gave a startled glance. &ldquo;She is fey!&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cinnamon!&mdash;&rsquo; what does she mean&mdash;&lsquo;Cinnamon&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked resentful and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sleepy lips shaped themselves again&mdash;&ldquo;Gran-nie.&rdquo; It
      slipped into a little sigh of content as she nestled into the arms that
      reached out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman smoothed the tumbled hair and rocked her shoulders gently to
      the cradling of her arms. &ldquo;Where was she, Hugh?&mdash;Where did ye
      find her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where she &rsquo;d no right to he,&rdquo; he said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d no right but to be in her bed,&rdquo; said the
      grandmother softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye &rsquo;d best put her there,&rdquo; he responded, looking down
      at the sleeping flower-face with unfathomable eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came back she found him sitting by the stove, his gaze fixed
      gloomily on its black surface, his body bent forward and his great hands
      swung loosely before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stirred the fire a little and pushed back the kettle on the stove.
      &ldquo;We &rsquo;re no needing it, the night,&rdquo; she said with happy
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no happiness in the old face across the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Hugh?&rdquo; She was looking at him with keen, gentle
      eyes that searched his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sim Tetlow,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand dropped from the kettle&mdash;&ldquo;Ye &rsquo;ve seen him, the
      night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had the bairn,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;He was holding it&mdash;in
      his arms&mdash;like his own.&rdquo; He looked up to her&mdash;bitter
      hatred in the red-rimmed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she came close to him, her soft dress making no sound. &ldquo;He cared
      for the bairn!&rdquo; It was half a question&mdash;a little cry of
      disbelief and longing&mdash;&ldquo;He cared for the bairn!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He were holding her,&rdquo; said Hugh gruffly&mdash;&ldquo;Same as
      you&mdash;or me.&rdquo; He lifted his hand with a swift gesture&mdash;&ldquo;Curse&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the hand, holding it to her bosom, forcing it there&mdash;&ldquo;No&mdash;Hugh&mdash;no,&rdquo;
      she breathed the words with little gasps&mdash;&ldquo;Ye &rsquo;ll no
      curse&mdash;we maun&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her savagely, struggling for a minute to free his hand. Then
      his eyes dropped. &ldquo;Ye &rsquo;re a woman,&rdquo; he said grimly.
      &ldquo;Ye &rsquo;ve no call to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stroked the hand with thin, knotted fingers, but her lips made no
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up under fierce brows. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll do to him as he
      &rsquo;s done to me.&rdquo; He said the words with deep accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;no&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He swept aside the words&mdash;&ldquo;He took away my engine,&rdquo; he
      said with slow wrath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ye slept, Hugh&mdash;And ye could not help the sleeping!&rdquo;
      It was a little cry of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been waking, the night and the day&mdash;and the night
      again,&rdquo; he replied fiercely, &ldquo;and I <i>slept</i>&mdash;Is
      sleepin&rsquo; a crime!&mdash;She was safe on the sidin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;There was no harm to Her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited with bent head. So many times they had lived through the steps
      of his disgrace&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; then he gi&rsquo;e me the switch. He were kind an&rsquo;
      just. He gi&rsquo;e me the <i>switch</i> to tend&mdash;&rdquo; Impotent
      bitterness filled the words&mdash;&ldquo;we&mdash;that&rsquo;d drove the
      best engines on the road! Tendin&rsquo; a switch&mdash;in the freight yard&mdash;&rdquo;
      His head sunk a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye was old, Hugh.&rdquo; It was the little cry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; he will be old!&rdquo; he broke in with tense, swift
      gesture&mdash;&ldquo;Old before his time, bent and broke! Oh, Lord&mdash;&rdquo;
      He lifted his gaunt face, &ldquo;Gi&rsquo;e him to me! Gi&rsquo;e him into
      <i>my</i> hand!&rdquo; The keen eyes, fixed on something unseen, stared
      before him. Hope struggled in them&mdash;a bitter, disbelieving hope.
      &ldquo;Gi&rsquo;e him into my hand!&rdquo;&mdash;he whispered.... &ldquo;into
      my hand!&rdquo; He bent forward, staring at the vision. Then the face
      changed subtly. He drew a quick, deep breath.... His head had dropped to
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent above him, &ldquo;Hugh&mdash;&rdquo; She called it to the
      unseeing eyes&mdash;&ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back a little dazed. The look in the face broke&mdash;&ldquo;Why,
      Ellen&mdash;woman.&rdquo; He put his arm almost tenderly about her&mdash;&ldquo;What
      frighted ye?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye &rsquo;ll not harm him?&rdquo; she cried. She leaned against
      him, her anxious, questioning eyes searching his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll not harm him,&rdquo; said the man briefly, &ldquo;except
      the Lord deliver him into my hand&mdash;I have it for a sign.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Scotch blood thrilled to the vague menace of the words. She pressed
      closer to him, her thin hands raised to his coat, grasping it on either
      side. She looked up into his face&mdash;&ldquo;Hugh, ye must forgi&rsquo;e&mdash;ye
      must e&rsquo;en&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must e&rsquo;en do the Lord&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; he said sternly.
      He loosed the clinging hands&mdash;&ldquo;Ye must sleep, Ellen,&rdquo; he
      said more gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands had dropped. They hung loose at her sides. But her meek eyes
      were still on his face. &ldquo;Ye will forgi&rsquo;e him,&rdquo; she
      whispered low, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his face gave no sign that he heard. He put out the lantern and raked
      together the coals in the stove, covering them carefully with ashes to
      save the smouldering heat. &ldquo;Come to bed, Ellen,&rdquo; he said when
      it was done, &ldquo;the bairn is safe. Ye can sleep now.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ho is managing?&rdquo;
      said Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had finished breakfast and sat with chairs pushed back from the
      table. It was the first question he had asked about the road. He had
      devoted himself to the business of getting well as thoroughly as to any
      business he had ever undertaken. But he was well now. &ldquo;Who is
      managing!&rsquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at him with a frank smile. &ldquo;Nobody is managing,&rdquo;
      he said&mdash;&ldquo;That &rsquo;s the worst of it. I &rsquo;ve been <i>doing</i>
      things&mdash;things that <i>had</i> to be done&mdash;and trying to stave
      off other people&rsquo;s managing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon nodded quickly. &ldquo;That &rsquo;s the best thing could have
      happened. I hope you &rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not altogether&mdash;The men in the office were all right....
      But the directors fidgeted some&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corbin,&rdquo; said Simeon, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said Simeon testily. &ldquo;And Dickerman, I
      suppose&mdash;yes, yes, I know&mdash;Go ahead now&mdash;Tell me
      everything.&rdquo; He leaned forward with elbows on the table&mdash;the
      old alert look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the recital was finished, he stood up, stretching his arms with a
      gesture of content. &ldquo;It might be worse,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may find it worse than you think,&rdquo; said the young man,
      &ldquo;No head to anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just legs and arms,&rdquo; said Simeon. He laid his hand in passing
      on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have legs and arms&mdash;good
      ones&mdash;than any heads I know of&mdash;except my own,&rdquo; he added
      laughing. &ldquo;When do we go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought down the special last night. She&rsquo;s at Bridgewater.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stetson with her! That &rsquo;s good. We start tonight&mdash;Get
      there at ten&mdash;Sleep home&mdash;Ready for business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled at the old, quick orders and went out to set them in motion.
      He looked up to the clear, keen sky with a sudden lightness of heart. A
      new day had come. Perhaps the tortoise had something the same feeling when
      Atlas stooped his shoulder to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      By night, the little house was stripped of its belongings. Some of them
      were packed in bags and boxes and the rest were to be stored in the loft
      overhead. The boughs of spruce and hemlock and pine had been taken down
      from the walls and burned in the fireplace during the day. The room was
      filled with the sweet, pungent odor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last minute John had hurried to the woods and brought back an
      armful of fresh boughs&mdash;spruce and pine, hemlock and blue-berried
      cedar&mdash;clustered thick&mdash;and trailing green vines. He tossed them
      lightly into the back of the sleigh and sprang in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special was waiting on the siding. They saw the little, flying puffs
      rise from her and float on the clear air.... Stetson was ready&mdash;with
      steam up&mdash;They would be off at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baggage master came forward to help with the bags. He spoke a word in
      John&rsquo;s ear as he passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man glanced quickly toward the engine that puffed and chugged at
      the head of the little train. He helped Simeon into the car and hurried
      forward. The man standing by the engine looked at him with troubled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; he said slowly, as John came up. &ldquo;He
      was took bad just after he came down.&rdquo; He nodded toward the baggage
      room, &ldquo;He told me to fire Up&mdash;ready to go ahead. Said you&rsquo;d
      know what to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned toward the baggage room. The engineer, out of a heap
      of blankets, spread across some trunks, regarded him somberly. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare. It gripes
      too hard when it comes. It&rsquo;s easier now, for a minute&mdash;But it
      &rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo; He writhed a little as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must n&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; said John quickly. He looked
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man put out a hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
      soon as she starts. I waited for you.&rdquo; John nodded. &ldquo;Is there
      anyone&mdash;on the others?&rdquo; He motioned toward the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head gloomily&mdash;&ldquo;Freights,&rdquo; he said. A
      kind of subtle pride underran the words&mdash;&ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t
      trust &rsquo;em with Her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man lifted his head&mdash;A swift thought had crossed his face.
      &ldquo;I saw Tomlinson on the street as we drove in&mdash;Could he-?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at him&mdash;&ldquo;Old Tomlinson?&rdquo; Justice weighed
      in the tone. &ldquo;You can ask him,&rdquo; he said grudgingly at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He &rsquo;s all right for it?&rdquo; questioned John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man writhed a little in his place. But justice held&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      all right if he says so,&rdquo; he answered. His teeth bit at the under
      lip, holding it firm, and he breathed hard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s first-class&mdash;Tomlinson.
      He won&rsquo;t <i>say</i> he can take her unless he&rsquo;s able. You can
      trust Tomlinson&mdash;same as you would me.&rdquo; The pride of
      brotherhood breathed in the words&mdash;lifting them mightily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll see him,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand held him back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t urge him.&rdquo; He gasped a
      little for breath between the words. &ldquo;If he says he can do it&mdash;let
      him take Her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll send some one
      for you.&rdquo; He was gone from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed the car, he hesitated a minute. Then he sprang up the step
      and went in. &ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; said Simeon looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stetson &rsquo;s sick&mdash;Shall we wait over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait over? No! Get somebody&mdash;Get <i>anybody!</i>&rdquo; He
      threw out the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man hesitated a minute. He had not mentioned Tomlinson&rsquo;s
      name to Simeon. Something had always pulled him back when he had thought
      to do it. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man&mdash;&rdquo; he said slowly&mdash;&ldquo;lives
      here&mdash;He &rsquo;s not running now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Competent?&rdquo; said Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stetson says so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson, one foot on the sleigh, looked at him under keen, shaggy brows.
      He glanced toward the station, with its wreathing, drifting lines of
      smoke. He shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; he said. He
      threw the halter into the sleigh and knocked the snow from his boots
      against the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      John watched him silently, as he climbed in and gathered up the reins in
      big,-mittened hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need you, Hugh,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded&mdash;impassive. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She &rsquo;ll</i> be waiting.&rdquo; He pulled a little on the
      reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send some one home with the team&mdash;There&rsquo;s Russell! Get
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotchman glanced with indifferent eye at a man crossing the street.
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve got my chores to do.&rdquo; He pulled again on the
      reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old horse lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      John laid a hand on the sleigh. &ldquo;See here, Hugh. We need you&mdash;There&rsquo;s
      no one else&mdash;He told me to get you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pull on the reins was checked. &ldquo;<i>Who</i> told you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;President Tetlow. He &rsquo;s waiting&mdash;&rdquo; He motioned
      toward the track where the special was blowing off steam. Hugh&rsquo;s eye
      followed the motion. It dropped to the young man. &ldquo;He told you&mdash;Sim
      Tetlow&mdash;&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;He wants <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He wants you&mdash;But not if you &rsquo;re not up to it&mdash;&rdquo;
      He had remembered Stetson&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man leaned forward, winding the reins slowly around the whip.
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll take Her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re not afraid!&rdquo; said John. Something in the face
      disturbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll take Her,&rdquo; said Hugh briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stetson&rsquo;s jumpers are in the cab,&rdquo; said John as they
      came down the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too short,&rdquo; said the old man. He was striding with mighty
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      John glanced at him. &ldquo;That &rsquo;s so&mdash;The coat&rsquo;s all
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said Hugh absently. His face had an absorbed
      look&mdash;The eyes beneath the fur cap gleamed like little points of
      light. When they reached the engine, the light broke and ran over his
      face. He mounted to the cab and laid his hand on the lever&mdash;&ldquo;I
      &rsquo;ll take her down, Johnny&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo; He
      nodded to the young man standing below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face cleared. &ldquo;All right, Hugh&mdash;It&rsquo;s the President of
      the Road you &rsquo;re carrying, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;It &rsquo;s Sim Tetlow&mdash;I know,&rdquo; said Hugh. He
      opened the lever a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man hurried toward the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; asked Simeon as he came in. The train was in slow
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was brought in and they ate it leisurely, watching the light change
      and fade upon the hills and darkness settle down outside. Simeon&rsquo;s
      eyes came back to the young man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I mean to know this
      country,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every mile of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled a little. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; said Simeon. &ldquo;I was born
      last night.&mdash;I was born last night,&rdquo; he said looking at the
      black window in a reverie. &ldquo;Who lives along here?&rdquo; He nodded
      toward the darkness. &ldquo;What kind of people!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John peered out. &ldquo;Winchendon, we just passed, was n&rsquo;t it? I
      don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never been here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever lived outside of Bridgewater!&rdquo; said Simeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About&mdash;!&rdquo; The lifted eyebrows held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon nodded. &ldquo;About anything. Steel works&mdash;button shop&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John thought a minute&mdash;&ldquo;You know as much as I do&mdash;more.
      They do a big business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of men?&rdquo; asked Simeon brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men?&mdash;In the works&mdash;you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In them&mdash;over them&mdash;on top&mdash;outside, inside,&rdquo;
      said Simeon. &ldquo;You know &rsquo;em, don&rsquo;t you? Lived with
      &rsquo;em&mdash;been to school with &rsquo;em&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;if you mean that&mdash;!&rdquo; A smile had come into the
      puzzled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that,&rdquo; said Simeon. He had lighted a cigar and was
      watching the tip intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigar went out and was relighted many times before the story of
      Bridgewater was finished. The slow mind of the narrator wandered in and
      out through the past, nudged by keen, quick questions from the nervous
      listener beside him. Little things loomed large&mdash;big things faded and
      slipped away in John&rsquo;s vision. It had been a mighty day for
      Bridgewater when the county house was built; but Simeon scoffed at the
      court-house and listened with rapt face to the story of two truckmen that
      John knew who had quarreled over their stand and made up, and joined
      against a third and held up the transportation of Bridgewater for three
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon sighed a little. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ve never lived,&rdquo; he said
      slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made money&mdash;I&rsquo;ve sat with my face
      close to a board, making money, studying moves&mdash;I&rsquo;ve played a
      good game&mdash;&rdquo; He said it grimly&mdash;&ldquo;But I &rsquo;ve
      never lived yet. My father always said &lsquo;Go in to win,&rsquo; and
      there was n&rsquo;t any mother.&rdquo; He said the words between the
      puffs.... &ldquo;And then I married&mdash;&rdquo; He waited a minute&mdash;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I
      guess I lived&mdash;a year. But I did n&rsquo;t know-then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the car. The train sped through soft, even darkness.
      The engine shrieked at a solitary grade crossing and was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man lifted his head. There was a deep smile in his eyes.... &ldquo;It
      &rsquo;s all going to be different,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;Just
      wait till we get things in hand&mdash;I &rsquo;m going over the road.&rdquo;...
      He drew a map from his pocket and spread it on the table.... &ldquo;Here
      is a place I want to know.&rdquo; He pointed to a corner of the map,
      &ldquo;They &rsquo;re always making a fuss up there&mdash;saying the road&rsquo;s
      got to come their way. The division superintendent says it won&rsquo;t pay&mdash;They
      say it will. I &rsquo;m going up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John leaned forward&mdash;&ldquo;Chester County.&rdquo; He spelled the
      name across the map. &ldquo;My father knows Chester County.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon looked up with quick stare... &ldquo;Your father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lived there when he was a boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know him,&rdquo; said Simeon. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll take him
      with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled at the picture&mdash;but underneath the smile ran a swift
      sense of his father&rsquo;s presence&mdash;its slow, steadying power upon
      the nervous, hurrying man. He would rest in the stolid strength of it.
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll bring him to see you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;What is your mother like?&mdash;You have not told me
      about your mother.&rdquo; He gazed at the boy deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one like her,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I could n&rsquo;t
      tell you. Nobody could tell about Mother.&rdquo; His glance had traveled
      to the rack overhead where the fragrant boughs hung out, filling the air
      with light fragrance&mdash;He saw the light in her face and her hands held
      out to them&mdash;He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon sighed and moved restlessly. He held another match to the cigar and
      his eye, as it followed the steady hand, filled with quick pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was watching the hand, too, and the eyes of the two men met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Simeon, throwing away the match
      with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said John with deeper meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I &rsquo;m a young man.&rdquo; He rose and paced a few steps in
      the car&mdash;&ldquo;I &rsquo;m forty-three&mdash;You don&rsquo;t call
      that old?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes watching him smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not old,&rdquo; said Simeon. He stretched himself to his
      full height, rapping his chest softly. He threw out his arm&mdash;toward
      the night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just beginning,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brakeman passed through the car-carrying something on his arm. A piece
      of old cloth, a bit of signal flag, was thrown carelessly across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s eye followed him to the rear of the car. After a minute he
      got up and went to the door. He opened it and stepped onto the platform.
      The brakeman was bending over the end of the car, peering down at
      something. He tested it once or twice with his hand before he scrambled to
      his feet. &ldquo;It &rsquo;s the red,&rdquo; he said as he saw who stood
      beside him. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t burn right&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; The train was swirling through
      the dark and they held to the guard-rail as they faced each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his cab, at the other end of the train, the old Scotchman, his body
      braced to the swing of the wheels, leaned out, looking back with tense
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can ye see her, Jim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fireman leaned beside him, for a moment, piercing the dark with swift,
      keen glance, &ldquo;Nothing there,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train, on the down grade by the river, ran with swift ease through the
      night.... No sight&mdash;no sound.... Only the great river to the left
      slipping&mdash;dark and still, and the stars overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the two men leaned back, scenting the dark with swift gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing there,&rdquo; said the fireman, peering out, &ldquo;You
      must &rsquo;a&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused&mdash;with quick turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, low whistle broke the night, echoing against the distant hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two men met. Tomlinson&rsquo;s hand raised itself with
      startled thrust. The answering shriek tore the night.... Once&mdash;twice&mdash;in
      hoarse demand....
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the low, seeking call among the hills. Then silence and the black
      river slipping by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fireman sprang to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomlinson&rsquo;s hand upon the lever quickened its hold, drawing it
      tense. &ldquo;We take no chances,&rdquo; he said. The engine trembled
      beneath and leaped to swifter stride. It swayed through the night. The
      furnace door flew open and heaven blazed with roar and glow and swift
      heat. The faces of the two men, lurid in the white glare, confronted each
      other. Then darkness, and the swift rush of steel on steel&mdash;crunching,
      heavy beats of sound&mdash;and the thrusting roar and smoke.... They were
      swinging the bend of the curve now, where the road leaves the river under
      the mountain to track across country. Tomlinson, his body half thrown from
      the cab, strained back, his peering eyes searching the distant curve. He
      drew his hand across them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She &rsquo;s there, Jim!.... Look!&rdquo; The shaking hand flung
      the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fireman leaped to his side. A glimmer&mdash;a flash&mdash;twinkled
      gleams on the far curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s Her!&rdquo; muttered Tomlinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;86,&rdquo; said the fireman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heaviest on the road.&rdquo; Tomlinson&rsquo;s hand reached
      Up....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was running at frightful speed. His quick eye gaged her flight as he
      sounded the high, shrill call of warning.... She had not slowed for the
      curve.... She was not slowing now! Again the whistle sounded its savage
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the note came back&mdash;echoing among the hills in little peals that
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;she had heard.... she knew they were there... They were
      safe now.&rdquo; The hand on the lever released its grip.... Gleason was
      running her. He was safe&mdash;Ten miles more.... Simeon Tetlow, swaying
      at ease in his parlor car, need not fear.... They were picked men on the
      road&mdash;and he ran them hard. They would bring him through....
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Tomlinson leaned out, looking back with a grim smile.... His
      startled gaze threw itself&mdash;She was <i>not</i> slowing&mdash;&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;
      It was hoarse like a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Jim!&mdash;Look!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fireman, bending to his flaming pot, had not heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red eyes blazed again to the night.... &ldquo;Jim!&mdash;&rdquo; The
      hoarse cry shook the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man sprang forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; He flung a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man leaned out. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; he said&mdash;He strained his
      eyes.... &ldquo;The brakes don&rsquo;t grip,&rdquo; he cried fiercely....
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s running wild!&rdquo; The words drove with the flying
      wind. He drew back, lifting a white face. &ldquo;Down grade,&rdquo; he
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;down grade,&rdquo; said Tomlinson, quietly. &ldquo;Pile
      on the coal, Jim!&rdquo; He flung the throttle wide. A great light broke
      across his face. &ldquo;Pile on the coal, Jim!&rdquo; The engine sprang.&mdash;&ldquo;Stuff
      her,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the flare and roar to the night&mdash;Great flying sparks.... Glory
      and fierce heat and the mighty power that throbbed to leap its bounds....
      Winged thrust&mdash;horns and hoofs, and spilling flame....
    </p>
    <p>
      The old engineer, his hand on the lever, balanced himself to the plunging
      flight. His small, peering eyes held the track ahead&mdash;they laid down
      the road before the wheels. And somewhere&mdash;far within&mdash;his soul
      laughed.... In the hollow of his hand he held him&mdash;The man who had
      scorned him&mdash;thrust him out.... &ldquo;You shall never touch throttle
      or brake or switch on this road.&rdquo; The wheels ground out the words.
      They beat them to powder and flung them&mdash;with hitter laugh and roar&mdash;upon
      the night.... He would not trust! And now he lay, like a baby, swung to
      the sound of wheels. Tomlinson laughed and set his teeth and leaned
      forward, squaring his shoulders.... His feet gripped the bounding floor.
      He would carry him safe.... They need not fear Tomlinson... .
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the car, Simeon Tetlow, absorbed in his map, looked up absently
      ... his glance on the swaying lamps&mdash;&ldquo;They &rsquo;re taking us
      down pretty fast,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man nodded. He was sitting across the table, his head Testing on
      his hand, his eyes, with their quiet light, fixed on Simeon&rsquo;s face.
      He had not stirred since he came in from the platform ten minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon, working on his map, looked up now and then with a little smile,
      and the quiet eyes smiled back. But something hungry had crept into them&mdash;a
      look of protection and longing&mdash;as if they would shield something
      helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train, in its heavy swing, lurched a little and Simeon looked up with
      a scowl that was half a laugh. The pencil had scrawled a curious, zigzag
      course across the paper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to be running this
      road,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might as well give up.&rdquo; He pushed the
      map from him and looked at his watch&mdash;&ldquo;9:40&mdash;Where are ye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just past Dunlop&rsquo;s crossing,&rdquo; said John..... At
      nine-forty, 86 was due at the crossing&mdash;the time-table in his pocket
      told it to him&mdash;five minutes off. Someone had blundered and she was
      in their block&mdash;close behind them&mdash;pressing upon them.... But
      the dull face gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty minutes,&rdquo; said Simeon. He stretched his arms with a
      little yawn&mdash;&ldquo;We &rsquo;ll be in by ten&mdash;you think!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we shall be in before ten,&rdquo; said the boy. His voice
      was very quiet, but the man looked up and saw the light in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward. &ldquo;What is it, John?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir&mdash;&rdquo; He said the words slowly. &ldquo;I was
      only wishing I could do something for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Boy&mdash;&rdquo; He turned his head a little, listening&mdash;The
      shrill whistle had sounded&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some train at Dunlop&rsquo;s&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train beneath them seemed gathering itself in mighty leaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cab, the old engineer, with tense body and set teeth, laughed
      grimly&mdash;&ldquo;I &rsquo;ll bring him in&mdash;<i>I &rsquo;ll bring
      him in!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The miles leaped behind them, flying. And behind them the express pounded
      heavily&mdash;soulless&mdash;massive&mdash;blind... five miles now&mdash;three&mdash;And
      the Scotchman laughed with the great lurches of his cab&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights of the upper station flashed past... then the lights of the
      yard... he threw the lever swiftly into place. The roar slackened and fell
      and ceased. The special was gliding easily down to her berth in the
      terminal shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The express, under control now, halted at the upper station, her blind eye
      glimmering through the dusk toward the little train that ran&mdash;smooth&mdash;safe,
      on its way. She gave a shrill cry&mdash;and puffed&mdash;impatient to be
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon put away the map in his pocket. He looked out into the busy yard as
      they drew in&mdash;little lights... slow-pulling freights&mdash;busy
      engines puffing up and down&mdash;smoke and grime. His own work. His heart
      leaped to it as he stepped from the car, and he lifted up his face to the
      great train shed&mdash;as in some great cathedral one looks up&mdash;and
      waits.... Whirling, drifting smoke&mdash;soaring and shimmering into the
      high roof.... Bells and voices and the sound of murmured calls... crimson
      torches flaring&mdash;skimming along the platforms&mdash;diving under
      engines&mdash;with hungry, peering eyes.... He took it in for a moment
      with deep, full breath before they swung down the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the engine an old man was bending with flaring torch, thrusting it
      into the heart of her, searching with careful eye for any harm that had
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Tomlinson!&rdquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure straightened itself and wheeled about, torch in hand.... His
      glance fell on the President of the Road and he stepped forward, a solemn
      look in the keen, blue eyes. He reached out a gaunt hand. The face,
      beneath its grime, held a deep, quiet power&mdash;&ldquo;I forgi&rsquo;e
      ye, Simeon Tetlow,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I forgi&rsquo;e ye,&mdash;now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The President of the Road took the grimy hand in his, with firm grip.
      &ldquo;It &rsquo;s all right, Tomlinson, all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment looking up at the tall figure, covered with oil and
      dirt&mdash;the smoke-stained face full of a kind of dignity.... &ldquo;You
      brought us down fast, Tomlinson,&rdquo; said the President of the Road
      with a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I brought ye fast,&rdquo; said Tomlinson. But there was no
      smile in the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gazing over their heads at something beyond them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The express had come to rest in the next berth and the great engine loomed
      above them&mdash;breathing softly&mdash;full of pride and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men looked at her for a minute, as if a magnet held them. Then
      the crowd, pouring out of the express, bore down upon them and swept them
      along. Tomlinson climbed back to his place in the cab, watching the two
      men until they were lost to sight in the jostling, hurrying throng. The
      express was a long one and the crowd streamed past... pushing, laughing...
      voices called... cramped limbs stretched themselves after the long ride
      and hurried a little; the platform resounded to light steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer of the express leaned from his window, on folded arms,
      looking down. He was a quiet man with thoughtful eyes and a serious
      face.... The eyes raised themselves and looked across at Tomlinson&mdash;above
      the heads of the happy, hurrying crowd&mdash;a straight, slow glance. Then
      he lifted his hand to him&mdash;the sign of the brotherhood&mdash;as one
      who salutes an equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tomlinson lifted his hand in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon emerged from the wicket gate, looking about with happy glance. The
      popcorn boy, scurrying to his place, the lights flaring and blazing,
      cabmen shouting&mdash;it was beautiful-all of it. He fell into the old,
      brisk walk and John, hurrying beside him, could hardly keep pace with
      it... . Joy was everywhere tonight&mdash;sound and bustle and quick-moving
      crowd. The nervous, hurrying frame vibrated to the city as a child to its
      mother&rsquo;s touch, or the heart to music.... He was back among his own&mdash;exile
      was done.... They pressed upon him&mdash;past him&mdash;around him. He
      jostled elbows, and was glad. He could have stretched out his hands to
      them&mdash;every one. The grasp of the old Scotchman&rsquo;s fingers
      lingered with him still&mdash;It crept np his arm in tiny thrills and
      warmed his heart. He must do something better for Tomlinson. There was
      strength in the old man still&mdash;with a grip like that! He rubbed his
      hand and shook his fingers a little ruefully at the very thought of it.
      How the old fellow had loomed&mdash;there on the platform&mdash;tall and
      grim! Then&mdash;in a flash&mdash;he saw him... in the green room, his
      head lifted high, his face stem... the very scent of the room was in the
      vision, pungent and fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a quick breath and threw back his head with a little impatient
      gesture. &ldquo;I shall never get out of those woods,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I can smell them&mdash;yet! lean smell them here.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy glanced at him with swift twinkle. &ldquo;Look behind you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon flashed back a quick look. Behind them was the porter, laden with
      bags and mgs. and bundles, and on his great shoulders the green branches
      swayed and nodded as he moved. They framed the big face with its gleaming
      smile&mdash;like some grotesque, dark-skinned dryad in the smoky station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon&rsquo;s eye sought the boy&rsquo;s&mdash;a little anxiously, it
      seemed, &ldquo;Going to trim the office?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed back. &ldquo;I &rsquo;m carrying them home to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He called a carriage, and the porter stowed away the boxes and bags and
      mgs, piling the mass of pine and spruce on the seat in front of them till
      the carriage was filled with its subtle fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simeon leaned forward in the half light and plucked a little spray of the
      cedar, placing it in his coat. &ldquo;That is for me,&rdquo; he said,
      smiling a little, as he buttoned the coat over it, &ldquo;the rest is for
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great office building loomed at the right as they drove, and he
      glanced out quickly. &ldquo;Same old place!&rdquo; he said. His face wore
      a contented look and his hand reached out, in the dim light, to the stubby
      one resting on the boy&rsquo;s knee and closed upon it for a moment with
      firm grasp.... &ldquo;Tomorrow, Boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we begin
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow, sir,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the house lightly, but not so lightly that her sensitive ear
      did not catch the sound and hold itself attent to listen&mdash;&ldquo;John?&rdquo;
      Her voice searched the darkness. &ldquo;John?&mdash;Is it you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in swiftly&mdash;&ldquo;Bad mother!&rdquo; He dropped on his knees
      beside her and laid his cool cheek to hers.... &ldquo;Bad mother&mdash;to
      lie awake!&rdquo; Her hand reached up to stroke his face.... &ldquo;How
      fragrant you are&mdash;like the woods!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fingers strayed a little and touched the feathery sprays and lingered&mdash;questioning.
      &ldquo;It is the woods! You have brought me the woods!&rdquo; The little
      cry of joy trembled in her voice. &ldquo;I shall sleep now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent and kissed her. &ldquo;Good-night, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, my son..&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusky, fragrant room she fell asleep, like a child, and she dreamed
      that she was-a child and wandered in a wood and that an angel with shining
      eyes came to her and walked with her under the green branches and when he
      went away she cried to him and he turned and kissed her and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought your breakfast, mother.&rdquo; So she wakened to
      another day.
    </p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &rsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
